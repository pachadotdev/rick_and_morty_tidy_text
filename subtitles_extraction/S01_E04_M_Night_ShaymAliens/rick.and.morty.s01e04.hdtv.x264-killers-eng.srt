1
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,370
Rick: t-t-t-this is just

2
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,369
Sloppy craftsmanship.

3
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,600
Morty: hey, Rick.

4
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,229
Boy, sure is really especially

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
Beautiful out there today, huh?

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,730
Rick: oh, yes, Morty.

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,829
I-it's almost unbelievable,

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,530
Isn't it?

9
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,729
Morty: yeah, you know?

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,200
There's something about the air

11
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,030
And just the way the sunshine

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:46,869
Is.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,969
Rick: uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,469
Sure. B-brilliant.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,530
Very convincing.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,769
Rick: wha convincing?

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,199
Morty: oh. Responsive, too.

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,229
In real time. I love it.

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,369
Morty: uhh...okay.

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,329
Beth: [ robotic ] i'm going

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,130
To work.

22
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,329
Morty, good morning.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,670
Dad, good morning.

24
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,469
I am going to work. Goodbye.

25
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,200
Morty: what's with mom?

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,530
Rick: oh, what's with mom?

27
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:04,500
So, you're saying that she's

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,530
Acting weird?

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,170
How soph[burps]isticated.

30
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,230
Careful, guys.

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,170
You're gonna burn out the cpu

32
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:09,929
With this one.

33
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,000
Morty: okay, you know what,

34
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:11,700
Rick?

35
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,569
You'reacting weird, too.

36
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,630
Rick: whatever,

37
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,500
Quote-unquote "Morty."

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,869
Morty: all right, well...

39
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,230
I'll see you after school.

40
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,530
Ow! Oof! Ugh!

41
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,599
Damn it!

42
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm all right. I'm okay.

43
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,700
Rick: [ slurps ]

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, who can tell me

45
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,129
What 5 x 9 is?

46
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,200
[ students whispering ]

47
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,129
Morty?

48
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,400
Morty: uh, me?

49
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,769
What is 5 x 9?

50
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,700
Morty: umm...you know, it's

51
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,230
Uhh...at least 40.

52
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,129
[ students gasp ]

53
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,170
Morty, that's exactly

54
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,429
Correct!

55
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,170
5 x 9 isat least 40!

56
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,700
Come up here.

57
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,329
Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

58
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,000
Everybody, this is the best

59
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:46,899
Student.

60
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,170
I want youto be the teacher

61
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:48,969
Today.

62
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:49,629
Teach us, Morty!

63
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,730
Rick: interesting.

64
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,700
Morty: w-w-w-what do you want

65
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,429
Me to teach you?

66
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,370
Ooh, ooh!

67
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,469
How do you make concentrated

68
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,599
Dark matter?

69
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,230
Oh, that's a good question.

70
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,670
Morty: concentrated huh?

71
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,829
Concentrated dark matter

72
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:00,969
The fuel for accelerated space

73
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,629
Travel.

74
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,400
Now, do you know how to make it?

75
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,100
Morty: umm...

76
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
Come on, Morty.

77
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,600
Isn't your grandpa, like, a

78
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,700
Scientist?

79
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,800
Morty: oh, yeah, but, you

80
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,969
Know, he told me that i

81
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,469
Shouldn't go around spouting off

82
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,330
About, you know, his science and

83
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,269
Stuff.

84
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,769
I bet you've seen him make

85
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,500
Concentrated dark matter a lot.

86
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,830
You know, if you tell us, i'll

87
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,199
Be your girlfriend.

88
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,330
Morty: uh, y-you will?

89
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,299
Seems like a rare

90
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,930
Opportunity, Morty.

91
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:23,669
[ blam! ]

92
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,800
Rick: Morty, u-uh, come on.

93
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,799
There's a family emergency.

94
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,969
Stop right there!

95
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,530
If he leaves, i'm giving him an

96
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,430
"f."

97
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,229
Rick: he doesn't care.

98
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,870
Morty: aw, man!

99
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,269
Rick, i have to go back!

100
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,129
I think i was about to get

101
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,530
Married!

102
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,469
Ugh!

103
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,070
Rick: take a shower with me,

104
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,530
Morty.

105
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,570
Morty: what?!

106
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,770
Rick: listen to me, Morty.

107
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,799
Get your clothes off and get in

108
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:38,829
The shower right now.

109
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:39,569
Y-y-y-you got to trust me,

110
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,300
Morty.

111
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,000
Morty: ugh!

112
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,930
I'm gonna get an "f" in class,

113
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:42,569
Rick.

114
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,400
Rick: Morty, that's not

115
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,369
Class.

116
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,569
T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher.

117
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,599
This isn't your school.

118
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,270
This entire world is not the

119
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,000
World.

120
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,330
We're inside a huge simulation

121
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:50,400
Chamber on an alien spaceship.

122
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,500
Morty: wait a minute.

123
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,630
W-what are you talking about?

124
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,599
Rick: it's all fake [burps]

125
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,000
Morty all of it.

126
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,900
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of

127
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,669
Crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

128
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,530
I couldn't say so until we got

129
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,530
In the shower.

130
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,670
They won't monitor us in here.

131
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,300
Morty: monitor us?! W-who?!

132
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,629
Rick: zigerion scammers,

133
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,069
Morty the galaxy's most

134
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,370
Ambitious, least successful con

Artists.

136
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,329
You know, it's lucky for us

137
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,329
They're also really

138
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,469
Uncomfortable with nudity.

139
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,600
Morty: aw, come on, Rick.

140
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,700
If everyone's just gonna be

141
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,669
Insane today, at least let me be

142
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,699
Insane with jessica.

143
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,599
Rick: i can't [burps] let you

144
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,469
Do that, Morty.

145
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,400
Morty: give it to me!

146
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,169
Rick: no! [ burps ]

147
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,000
You give it to me!

148
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,000
Morty: g-g-give it! No, Rick!

149
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,229
[ aliens groaning ]

150
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,229
Oh, god, sir!

151
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,129
They're still naked!

152
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,930
Ugh.

153
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,569
Well, check every five quintons

154
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,030
And tell me when they're not.

155
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,300
I think we should make kevin

156
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,099
Look, sir.

157
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,030
What?! No!

158
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,730
W-w-why would you even say that?

159
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,030
Uh, sir, we have a situation

160
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,900
Over here.

161
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,569
If there's a wiener on that

Monitor, i swear to god, stu...

163
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,500
Something is drawing a lot of

Processing power.

165
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh, wait. No wonder.

166
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,099
There's another real human in

167

The simulator.

How did this happen?!

Wait. You know what?! No!

The milk people don't have a

Patent on simple rhetorical

Questions!

525
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,000
There's not even a single word

526
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,470
In "hungry for apples" that's

527
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,700
Shared by "got milk?"

528
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,129
It's a completely different

529
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:11,769
Slogan.

530
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,529
It's different!

531
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,299
And i shouldn't be fired.

532
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,629
I should be promoted!

I mean, i'm it may be

539
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,569
Derivative, but it's the most

540
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,800
Successful campaign to come out

541
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,830

Jerry: i-i'm not saying it

544
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,000
Should win an award for

545
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,370
Commercials, but it could

546
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,399
Certainly be nominatedfor an

547
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,370
Award for commercials

548
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,669

Award called the appley for

553
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:37,269
Apple-related ad campaigns?

[ snaps fingers ] yes.

555
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:38,829
Jerry: could we nominate me?

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,570
[ snaps fingers ] yes.

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm gonna [burps] be able to use

561
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,730
These processors to make some

562
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,230
Real important science stuff.

Huh.

565
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,969
I thought i entered the code

566
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,500
Right.

567
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,929
[ keypad beeping ]

568
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,730
Wha well, what's this?

569
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,799
W-what could this possibly be?

570
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,330
Because it looks like you're

571
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,899
Inside a simulation...

572
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,399
Inside a simulation.

573
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,029
You're still on the ship.

Too loud and too specific.

Concentrated dark matter for a

But now we alsoknow the code to

Will now be ours!

590
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,070
Rick: uh, yeah, until i get

591

That is why you're never

This morning, i didn't even know

This award existed.

Was the best day of my life...

But...the truth is, it's it's

More meaningful than that.

Can get the hell out of here!
