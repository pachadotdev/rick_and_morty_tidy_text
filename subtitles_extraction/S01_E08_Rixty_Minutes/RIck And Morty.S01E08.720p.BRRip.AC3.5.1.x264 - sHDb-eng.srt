00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,632
Boy fuck you, John,

315
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,385
you fuckin' dumb, stupid idiot.

316
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,388
Come on, Gazorpazorpfield.
Go easy on me, huh?

317
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,182
You dumb, stupid, weak,

318
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,310
pathetic, white, white,

319
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,646
uh... guilt...

320
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,065
white-guilt milquetoast

321
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,109
piece of human garbage.

322
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,473
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield,
that's...

323
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,070
you know, you're
pretty mean to me,

324
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,321
but that takes the cake.

325
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,989
I don't give a fuck.

326
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,283
I'm Gazorpazorp-fuckin'-field, bitch.

327
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,619
Now give me my
fucking enchiladas.

328
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,913
Hey, Rick, you know, did they
use Bill Murray for this?

329
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,456
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

330
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,916
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,584
In this reality,
he's still alive.

332
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh, okay.
Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

333
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,963
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

334
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,923
He also did the voice of that
one guy from "Ghostbusters,"

335
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,050
which is really strange
because it's the same character

336
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,260
Bill Murray played in the movie.

337
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,719
But then, when they
made the movie,

338
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,847
Bill Murray did the voice
of Gazorpazorp...

339
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,891
- or Garfield, I mean.
- That's pretty cool, Rick.

340
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,767
So all that happened
in this reality, too?

341
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,935
I don't know.

342
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,478
Just making conversation
with you, Morty.

343
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,938
What, you think
I'm a... I'm...

344
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,065
I know everything about
everything?

345
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,234
Did you really talk me
out of the abortion?

346
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,487
Well, we... we blew a tire
on the way to the clinic.

347
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,866
I think, in my head, I was
doing it all for the kids.

348
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,369
And now the first kid is going
to do something with turquoise.

349
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,496
[ sighs ] Which is either
code for crystal meth

350
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,373
or a gateway to it.

351
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,500
So we didn't do
the kids any favors.

352
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,378
So we should stay together
for each other and ourselves,

353
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,255
or...

354
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,174
Or...

355
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,595
Man, woman, and now Trunkman?

356
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,513
We know science has created
men that have a trunk

357
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,140
that allows them
to have sex with both

358
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,225
male and female partners.

359
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,519
But we don't like the idea of
these people getting married.

360
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,314
Put a line in the sand,
everybody.

361
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,107
Vote "no" on proposition XW2.

362
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,526
The act that says trunkpeople
can get married.

363
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,903
Who needs it?

364
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,404
Not on my watch.

365
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,283
Paid for by Michael Denny
and The Denny Singers.

366
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,410
Hi. I'm a trunkperson,
and I want...

367
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,163
I feel love in my heart, too,
just like you.

368
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,998
I wanna be able
to express that love

369
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,791
with both a man and a woman.

370
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,293
And I won't be able to

371
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,629
if Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way.

372
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,131
Hey, let the trunkpeople have
sex and get married, huh?

373
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,842
Paid for by trunkpeople.

374
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,011
Oh, I love me
strawberry sniggles.

375
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,138
Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets
my hands on me

376
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,433
and tries to steal
my strawberry smiggles.

377
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,918
I'm gonna eat every last
one of them,

378
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,895
because... and then
they'll be in my stomach,

379
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,980
and nobody will ever be
able to eat them.

380
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,441
Except for me, because they'll
be all inside my stomach.

381
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,820
Um, my name is
Mr. Tophat Jones,

382
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,656
and God forbid anyone ever
take my sner...

383
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,449
little-people snibbles.

384
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,951
I'm keeping them all for me.

385
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,994
Mmm. Mmm.

386
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,038
Last bite.
Mmm.

387
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,040
Oh, now they're all resting
comfortably in my stomach.

388
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,583
Ooh, am I feeling good.

389
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,877
No! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

390
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,879
There's no more strawberry
snibbles... no!

391
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,548
[ chokes, sputters]

392
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,466
Jesus Christ!

393
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,134
Jesus Christ! It hurts!

394
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,636
My entrails are out!

395
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,179
Why would you even want
to eat these?

396
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,348
They're soaked
with my stomach acid.

397
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, Jesus Christ, lord, savior,

398
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,477
and spirit, save me.

399
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,187
Take me to the light.

400
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,939
Oh, my god. I see demons.

401
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,482
I see demons are coming!

402
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,192
Geez, Rick.
Oh, my god.

403
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,637
That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

404
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,571
you know, for a cereal
commercial.

405
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,156
Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

406
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,950
you gotta pump the gas a little.

407
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,660
Pedal to the metal, Morty.

408
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,080
In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

409
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,748
and they're coming strong,

410
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,377
there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

411
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,629
Get down. Hurry. Run.

412
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,172
[ screeching]

413
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,385
And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

414
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,096
and you got to take care of it.

415
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,515
With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

416
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,269
no room is safe
from the turbulent power

417
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,396
of Turbulent Juice.

418
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,398
- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

419
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,400
Sex sells what?

420
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,986
Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

421
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,487
- [ sighs ]
- Hey, Dad.

422
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,989
- God.
- What's going on?

423
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,833
Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

424
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,409
some time apart, Morty.

425
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,411
And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

426
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,247
- What?
- Speaking of [burps] what,

427
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,626
Morty, [burps]
what should we watch next?

428
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,461
What about this?

429
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,421
Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

430
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,965
But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

431
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,967
So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

432
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,427
Hey, there.

433
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,429
Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

434
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,265
because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

435
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,059
Babylegs, don't talk back to me.

436
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,560
Good luck, you two.

437
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,604
There's a criminal to kill.
[ slurps]

438
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,648
Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

439
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,650
Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

440
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,443
Look, Babylegs.
It's the criminal.

441
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
Oh, fuck it. I'm the killer.
I'm running.

442
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,279
I'm running real quick.

443
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,281
Babylegs, here we go!

444
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,158
[trilling ]

445
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,827
That's the sound I make
when I'm trying to run fast.

446
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,621
[trilling ]

447
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,456
All right, I'm not
gonna get him.

448
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,458
I just learned a real
valuable lesson.

449
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,168
I'm coming, Babylegs.

450
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,045
I'm... Regularlegs.

451
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,672
[ grunts ] We got him.

452
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,340
Hey, that was good teamwork.

453
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,217
Babylegs and Regularlegs,

454
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,219
I'm proud of you two
for working together.

455
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,221
And, Babylegs, I know
it was hard for you

456
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,682
to come to the conclusion
that you need a partner,

457
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,266
but I'm proud of you
that you did it.

458
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,351
Hey, thanks, Chief.

459
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,061
Now get the fuck out of here.

460
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,646
Pretty cool, huh, Morty?

461
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,231
Oh.
- I thought it was cool.

462
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,693
I don't give a fuck what
you think, Jerry.

463
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,777
[ click ]

464
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,574
Hey, uh, y-you doing okay?

465
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,243
I kind of know how you feel,
Summer.

466
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,120
No, you don't.
You're the little brother.

467
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,924
You're not the cause of your
parents misery.

468
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,624
You're just a symptom of it.

469
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,669
- Can I show you something?
- Morty, no offense...

00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,712
but a drawing of me you made
