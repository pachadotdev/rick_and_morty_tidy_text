700
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
  HERE, MORTY, PUT THIS ON WHILE I

701

  SAY  YOU REALLY PULLED A

705

  I MEAN, I-I REALLY THOUGHT THAT

708
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,930
  THE WHOLE PLACE WAS GONNA BE

709
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,300
  MESSED UP FOR GOOD, BUT HERE,

710
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,800
  YOU DID IT  Y-Y-YOU  YOU 

711
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,099
  YOU FIGURED OUT THAT CRAZY

712

  >> Rick: COME ON, MORTY.

716
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,430
  LUCK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

717
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,170
  I'M GREAT.

718
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,770
  THAT'S THE REAL REASON.

719
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,700
  NOW, MORTY, WHAT DO YOU SAY,

720
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,430

  IT'S FINE. EVERYTHING IS FINE.

752
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,400
  THERE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER OF

753
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,900
  REALITIES, MORTY, AND IN A FEW

754
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,070
  DOZEN OF THOSE, I GOT LUCKY AND

755
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,830
  TURNED EVERYTHING BACK TO

756
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,800
  NORMAL.

757
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,970
  I JUST HAD TO FIND ONE OF THOSE

758
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,170
  REALITIES IN WHICH WE ALSO

759
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,000
  HAPPEN TO BOTH DIE AROUND THIS

760
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,930
  TIME.

761
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,300
  NOW WE CAN JUST SLIP INTO THE

762
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,870
  PLACE OF OUR DEAD SELVES IN THIS

763
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,830
  REALITY AND EVERYTHING WILL BE

764
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,700
  FINE.

765
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,500
  WE'RE NOT SKIPPING A BEAT,

766
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,270
  MORTY.

767
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,270
  NOW, HELP ME WITH THESE BODIES.

768
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,330
  >> Morty: THIS IS INSANE.

769

  >> Rick: LOOK, MORTY, I'LL GRAB

770
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,770
  MYSELF, YOU GRAB YOURSELF, OKAY?

771
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,970
  I MEAN, T-T-T-THAT SEEMS FAIR TO

772
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,030
  ME  I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE A

773
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,129
  FAIR WAY TO DIVVY IT UP.

774
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,170
  >> Morty: RICK, WHAT ABOUT THE

775
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,270
  REALITY WE LEFT BEHIND?

776
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,370
  >> Rick: WHAT ABOUT THE REALITY

777
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,070
  WHERE HITLER CURED CANCER,

778
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,000
  MORTY?

779
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,730
  THE ANSWER IS DON'T THINK ABOUT

780
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,470
  IT.

781
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,670
  IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN DO THIS

782
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,700
  EVERY WEEK, ANYWAYS.

783
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,570
  WE GET THREE OR FOUR MORE OF

784
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,370
  THESE, TOPS.

785
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,400
  NOW, PICK UP YOUR DEAD SELF AND

786
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,930
  COME ON.

787
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,230
  HASTE MAKES WASTE.

788
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,430
  I-I-I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE

789
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,830
  CONSIDERED THIS DETAIL, BUT

790
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,200
  OBVIOUSLY, IF I HADN'T SCREWED

791
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,800
  UP AS MUCH AS I DID, WE'D BE
