00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,940
- Clean up that mess this instant!
- No. I'm a dirty girl.

152
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,693
- Uh...
- I'm filthy.

153
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,029
- You are being very bad.
- You'll have to punish me later.

154
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,823
[both chuckling]

155
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,909
Jill and I have a very...
special relationship.

156
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,453
Want to tell me about the show?
I hear it's great.

157
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,706
I've worked on great shows
my whole career.

158
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,082
Great shows are easy.

159
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,919
I didn't become president of the <i>Lampoon</i>
so I could make "great" shows.

160
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,422
- <i>Harvard Lampoon.</i>
- Yeah, I got it.

161
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,549
I'm trying to do something different here.

162
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,759
- Something that lasts.
- Huh.

163
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,677
Think about it.

164
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,389
If you're ready to finally stop being
"The Horse" from <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

165
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,018
send me an e-mail:
Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.

166
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,811
- That's H-A-R--
- I got it.

167
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,646
[gasps]

168
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,191
You got some mail, babe.

169
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,987
Mwah! You understand I'm using
that pet name ironically, right?

170
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,071
Yes, Wayne.

171
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,534
Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from <i>The New Yorker.</i>

172
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:59,289
That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys?

173
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,665
Yup.

174
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,334
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,

175
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,004
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,

176
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,507
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?

177
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,927
Caring leads to disappointment?
Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?

178
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,930
Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.

179
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,267
Their journalistic style
couldn't be more outmoded.

180
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,229
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."
- I never even thought they'd read it.

181
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,525
"Talk of the Town"?
More like "Schlock of the Clown".

182
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,112
Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".

183
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,074
"Shouts and Murmurs"?
More like "Louts and..."

184
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,617
What rhymes with murmurs?

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,702
For two people
who don't like <i>The New Yorker,</i>

186
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,663
you know a lot about the different
sections of <i>The New Yorker.</i>

187
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,374
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:

188
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,503
"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories

189
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,880
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"

190
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,300
And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."

191
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,260
Sounds like you two really hit it off.

192
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,513
We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.

193
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,223
So you're gonna do the show?

194
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,183
- Nah. Timing's really off right now.
- [sighs]

195
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,186
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.

196
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.

197
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,942
I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?

198
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,736
Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.

199
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,367
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?

200
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,787
What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

201
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,832
BoJack, you are amazing.

202
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,418
You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.

203
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,504
But if you can't see that,

204
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,715
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.

205
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,221
- [pop music playing]
- [laughter and chatter]

206
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,392
How long do we have to stay in here?

207
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,727
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
- Uh...

208
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,437
We don't have to kiss.

209
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,731
I know you'd rather be in here
with Kimber.

210
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,609
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...

211
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,404
- What?
- I've never kissed anyone before.

212
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,948
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other?

213
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,702
That way, when you're in here with Kimber
one day, you'll know exactly what to do.

214
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:06,124
Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?

215
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,627
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do
because I practice all the time

216
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,754
with a picture of Adam Brody--
No, I don't!

217
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,797
[chuckles]

218
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,718
Just close your eyes,
and we move our faces toward each other.

219
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,680
- Okay.
- Until we...

220
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,353
- [sighs]
- [Marv] Oh!

221
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,149
Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.

222
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:36,863
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,
guess who just got BoJack a job.

223
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:41,618
You... are the secretary
of a wonderful agent.

224
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,330
Now go pick up
a pair of satin crotchless undies.

225
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,207
I saw a stewardess
at the Yum Yum Donuts.

226
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,668
We did not make eye contact.

227
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,546
[man] <i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

228
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,883
<i>It's two months later in 2007.</i>

229
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,427
[man 2] <i>Two months later?</i>
<i>Two months later than what?</i>

230
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,803
[man 1] <i>Did I say two months later?</i>

231
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus,</i>
<i>I think I'm having a stroke.</i>

232
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
Aaah!

233
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,894
- Jeez, sleep much?
- Jeez, watch me sleep much?

234
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,312
Well, I couldn't sleep.

235
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,314
I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.

236
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,066
These things
are always so nerve-wracking,

237
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,319
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--

238
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,738
- Professional actor?
- Very funny.

239
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,574
- Before I forget, I got you a present.
- [gasps]

240
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:26,079
It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.

241
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,455
How did you know?

242
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,374
Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.

243
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,794
Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

244
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,712
Promise me
everything's going to be okay?

245
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,923
I promise it's gonna be great.

246
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,384
If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.

247
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,221
I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

248
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
- Mmm...
- Mm-mmm-mm.

249
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,979
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle
into the garbage. Thud."

250
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,522
"Goodbye, old friend."

251
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,942
"Mitch turns off the light
and closes the door as we...

252
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,528
Fade to black. End of episode."

253
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,574
Thank you.

254
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,620
Let's see what the suits say.

255
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,623
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,
make it appeal to middle America.

256
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,875
[groans] That's the worst part of America.

257
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,461
Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.

258
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,756
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,
what can we say?

259
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,010
This is why you guys are the pros
and we're just the schmoes.

260
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,930
I think what my husband
is trying to say is, "Great job."

261
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,390
Enough with the torture.

262
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,851
Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.

263
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,562
[laughs] Our only note? No notes.

264
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,023
- No notes?
- We love this show.

265
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,983
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.

266
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,319
This show is gonna be as big
as <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

267
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,779
[gulps]

268
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,322
Huh.

269
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:49,245
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?
You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."

270
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,122
- It was so funny.
- Wow.

271
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,375
It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.

272
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,211
You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.

273
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,424
Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.

274
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,261
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

275
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,264
Hello? Can we please get
some service in this place?

276
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,685
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.

277
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,354
Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.

278
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,775
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.

279
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,985
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?

280
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,113
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.

281
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,824
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.

282
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,286
Website? We gotta print it out
on our own paper with our own ink?

283
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,704
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- Mom.

284
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,249
And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.

285
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,752
I still don't get how that's gonna work,
at all.

286
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,587
Babe, it makes total sense.

287
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,131
They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.

288
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,217
People go to their local Blockbuster Video

289
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,053
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.

290
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,180
What if someone already rented
the episodes they want?

291
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,101
They can just get something else,
like <i>The Illusionist </i>or <i>The Prestige.</i>

292
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,895
- Whichever one you were in.
- Do you know which one?

293
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,398
- Do you?
- [groans]

294
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:03,111
- Why do you say yes to everything?
- I get excited by the possibilities.

295
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,280
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.

296
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,241
- Buying it.
- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.

297
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,201
- Drop it. Drop it.
- [whimpers]

298
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,494
Good boy.

299
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,666
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!

300
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,252
- You heard what the network said.
- Heard they loved it.

301
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,920
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

302
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,047
Exactly. The network loved it.

303
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,924
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

304
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,344
If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.

305
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,348
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."

306
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,810
- That'll be funny in a year or so.
- Before that got sad and weird,

307
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,271
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.

308
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,107
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.

309
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,735
Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as <i>Horsin' Around</i>."

310
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,071
Is that what you wanted?
That's not why I'm here.

311
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,782
- I know.
- I really think you're making a mistake.

312
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,284
I'm not taking career advice

313
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,786
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.

314
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,581
Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?

315
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,125
- What do you think you are?
- I don't know.

316
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,210
Here's some free advice:
you should know.

317
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,171
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?

318
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,131
Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.

319
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,008
Okay, best of luck.

320
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,259
[clears throat]

321
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,053
Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night

322
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:15,725
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.

323
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,018
I'm in.

324
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,899
What's that, you say?
There's a panic? At the disco?

325
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,901
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?

326
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,570
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.

327
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,573
[groans] Again with this
"I wanna be a female agent" thing.

328
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,994
They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.

329
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,331
- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
- Okay, okay!

330
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,251
You're an agent, all right?
I dub thee agent.

331
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,046
You can even take my office,
because I quit.

332
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,881
- What?
- Who needs the headache?

333
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:53,221
Thirty years I threw into this job
and it destroyed me from the inside out.

334
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:57,016
I never fell in love,
I never had a family.

335
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,269
I never even got to give that lacy teddy

336
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,481
to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.

337
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,735
[sighs] All I have is regrets.

338
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,282
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.

339
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,036
Whaah!

340
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,081
First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.

341
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,503
How do we make it clear
that this isn't <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

342
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,589
What if in the very first scene,
we show my character

343
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:33,844
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

344
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,179
What? That's insane.

345
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,140
Let's just put it in,
we can always take it out later.

346
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,643
I want this character to be really edgy,

347
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,437
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:

348
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,189
"This character's too edgy for me."

349
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,733
What if he had a catchphrase
that was an anti-catchphrase?

350
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,654
Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"

351
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,991
Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.

352
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:55,950
Whassup, bitches?

353
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,202
- That is so dumb.
- But kind of brilliant, right?

354
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,581
Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.

355
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,292
This should be the show.

356
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,211
I haven't felt this alive
since the head of the Charles Regatta.

357
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,839
- That's a Harvard thing.
- Yes. This is brilliant.

358
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925
What if we had five minutes of him
reading a book to himself?

359
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,302
Oh, my God, yes.

360
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,471
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.

361
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,558
- [bottle breaks]
- The real shit, they never show that.

362
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,852
Wow, we did it.

363
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,106
We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.

364
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,774
We've changed everything but the title.

365
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,319
Well, then, how about
we give it a new title?

366
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,529
- <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>
- [gasps]

367
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,948
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.

368
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,368
Well, then why don't you just say,
"Whassup, bitches?"

369
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,203
But, you know, not that.

370
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,581
- Something like that.
- We'll figure it out.

371
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,880
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.

372
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,132
To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.

373
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,426
I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier

374
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,596
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.

375
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,725
I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.

376
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,353
- Four hundred dollars.
- I don't know what's cheesier,

377
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,897
this three-cheese risotto
or that dude's patter.

378
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,856
Seriously.

379
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:13,319
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser
for a better host of this fundraiser.

380
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,278
Totes McGotes.

381
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,989
I'll post that to my Twitter page.
You should follow me.

382
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,701
I'm A with a circle around it,
"insWayne in the membWayne".

383
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,286
- [Diane sighs]
- What's a Twitter page?

384
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,749
[chuckling] Erica, you know you're not
allowed to vote in national elections.

385
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,585
[electronic music playing]

386
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,090
You sure it's okay
to be in your parents' bedroom?

387
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,010
Todd, so we've been together
for months now.

388
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,181
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?

389
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,099
Uh...

390
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,935
We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.

391
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,189
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.

392
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,943
- Um...
- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.

393
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,861
Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.

394
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:01,117
Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

395
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,577
- [garage door opening]
- Did you hear that?

396
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,248
Oh, snap. My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.

397
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,874
Your dad, the mobster?

398
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,459
What? My dad's not a mobster.

399
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,878
You said he was like that guy
from <i>The Sopranos.</i>

400
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,589
I said he works on <i>The Sopranos</i>.
He's an editor.

401
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,591
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.

402
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,969
He must be so desensitized to violence

403
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,972
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.

404
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,224
Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right?

405
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:29,061
You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.

406
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,604
Use this.

407
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,066
- Go, get out. Go, go!
- Uh, okay.

408
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,777
Oh, shit.

409
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,654
[grunts]
Sorry.

[panting]

Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?

<i>Mamma mia!</i>

- So, the island's purgatory, right?
- What's really happening--

414
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,339
- Hold that thought.
- [groans]

415
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,967
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

416
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,846
I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.

417
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,682
I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.

418
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,101
I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.

419
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,020
Ouch.

420
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,439
Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.

421
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,356
Yeah.

422
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,568
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around?"</i>

423
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,529
From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."

424
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,406
I'm happy for you, BoJack.

425
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,075
- How about a kiss for good luck?
- No, BoJack.

426
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,746
I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.

427
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:33,000
But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.

428
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,629
I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.

429
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,590
I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.

430
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,342
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.

431
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,055
And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

432
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,350
- You did?
- Yeah. Everybody did.

433

Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.

Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?

435
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,569
There are a lot of big producers,

[groans]
This podunk benefit is below us.

437

I'm about to be in what I've been told
is a very important gay rights movie,

438
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.</i>

439
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,957
I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.

440
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,795
- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."
- Hey, if you like Justin so much,

441
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,589
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.

442
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,424
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.

443
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,009
Uh, I didn't say that.

444
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,846
I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.

445
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,515
[sobbing]

446
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,602
- You wanted water?
- Thanks.

447
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,231
Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.

448
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,401
What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?

449
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,362
I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.

450
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,533
You "bariste" and cater <i>and</i> waiter?
[laughs] Triple threat.

451
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,451
I should be bringing you the water.

452
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:54,081
You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.

453
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,625
A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.

454
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,919
They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.

455
00:22:59,003 --> 00:22:59,878
That's dumb.

456
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,090
If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.

457
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,427
- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.

458
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,513
I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."

459
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,683
Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."

460
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,561
- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?
- Go ahead.

461
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,813
[groans] This monkey suit is killing me.

462
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,274
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

463
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,236
Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.

464
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,614
- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
- What?

465
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,991
I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke

466
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,493
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity

467
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,164
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

468
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,415
[laughing]

469
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,085
"Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.

470
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,087
Thanks. I'm Diane.

471
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,922
- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah, I know.

472
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,633
- Add me on MySpace, okay?
- Sure.

473
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:50,054
All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

474
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,181
It's Diane.

475
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,226
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.

476
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,312
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.

477
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,689
What do you mean?
We premiere in two minutes.

478
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,399
Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.

479
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,860
Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a <i>Horsin' Around</i> VHS.

480
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,739
BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember?

481
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,116
Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.

482
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,578
This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.

483
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,831
BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

484
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,917
I can't promise everyone
will love this show.

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,752
No matter what, people will remember it.

486
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,297
Five, ten years from now, this is the show
people will associate you with,

487
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,132
and you'll be glad they do.

488
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,094
Because this show is real,
it's edgy, it's different.

489
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,554
A lesser talent
couldn't have pulled it off.

490
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,015
But I'm willing to bet
on BoJack Horseman.

491
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,643
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

492
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,189
Great. Because the show is starting
and your life is about to change forever,

493
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,817
in three, two, one.

494
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,777
