303
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,945
You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.

304
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,322
I can want that
and also want professionalism.

305
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,200
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?

306
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,619
Is there a single woman
you've worked with

307
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,872
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?

308
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,583
Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?

309
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,919
All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.

310
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,922
Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,

311
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,550
I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,

312
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,343
you would only hear the one mean thing.

313
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,679
I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.

314
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,682
- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.

315
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,726
Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?

316
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,271
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.

317
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,524
- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

318
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,526
Two, you are loved by millions.

319
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,446
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

320
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,030
I got this. I got this.

321
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,116
Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?

322
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,993
Excuse me? Waiter?

323
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
Where are my family's
double-fudge cheese pies?

324
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,747
I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.

325
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,626
- Then who's our waiter?
- Uh, you're the waiter now. Ta-da!

326
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,961
I can't be a waiter.

327
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,464
I have a very important
business meeting tomorrow.

328
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,050
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!

329
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,470
Okay. Who gets these
soy balls and onion cubes?

330
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,054
Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.

331
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,473
You got it, boss.

332
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,517
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.

333
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,270
So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>

334
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,856
[laughs] You recognize
you're being impossible, right?

335
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,444
- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you, BoJack.

336
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,947
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.

337
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,617
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.

338
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,286
Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.

339
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,537
Or when my dad died

340
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,457
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.

341
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,418
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?

342
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,963
- Did you ever love me? At all?
- I don't-- I'm not--

343
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,801
You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.

344
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:55,139
Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

345
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,390
Yeah.

346
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,101
Ugh. This sucks. Ow.

347
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,104
I did this to myself. I do this to myself.

348
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,524
- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.

349
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,567
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,

350
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,778
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--

351
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,820
[screams]

352
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!

353
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,078
- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!

354
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,666
[groans] I figured out
how to pre-heat the oven.

355
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,544
This night has been a disaster.

356
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,838
The good news is I got my kid
to prep my important meeting at work.

357
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,299
The bad news is
all the customers went home.

358
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,634
They didn't like the screaming

359
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,303
and felt like their food
was a little too "on fire".

360
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,681
- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.

361
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,225
Oh, oh, oh!

362
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,561
She still wants her mushroom risotto.

363
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,565
I don't know how to make risotto.

364
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,691
I know how.

365
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
What are you doing? No, go home.

366
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,279
You're right. What am I doing?

367
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,613
All right.

368
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,325
Good luck.

369
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,453

Goddamn it.

379

How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

380
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,325
We have to choose!
We're running out of time.

381
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,494
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?

382
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,872
Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.

383
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,083
Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass

384
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,419
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.

385
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,130
I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.

386
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,343
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,
I'd rather not get involved.

387
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,511
- Can I get you some more water?
- Mmm.

388
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,597
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.

389
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,641
Mom, I wanna go home.

390
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,893
This is a very important night
for the restaurant.

391
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,480
How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?

392
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,442
Winslow wants the big conference room
for his presentation to corporate.

393
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,528
You get back on that phone
and you get me that big room.

394
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,405
Okay, Mom.

395
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,659
The secret is stirring continuously.

396
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,161
Right, so that's the secret.

397
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.

398
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,209
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

399
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,169
How do you know how to do this?

400
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,296
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.

401
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,466
She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much. Glug, glug.

402
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,929
So unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.

403
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,766
That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.

404
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,061
And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.

405
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,647
"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"

406
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,316
- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.

407
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,820
- How come you never told me that?
- I did.

408
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,737
Oh.

409
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,823
It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.

410
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,867
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.

411
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,121
<i>I went to see Marv. You were</i>
<i>at the desk in front of his office.</i>

412
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>I thought you were cute and you said,</i>
<i>"It's good to see you again."</i>

413
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,254
- Oh. So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.

414
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,341
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.

415
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,137
<i>You were passed out in the yard,</i>
<i>covered in tapioca pudding.</i>

416
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,973
<i>I hosed you down, dragged you inside,</i>
<i>covered you with a blanket.</i>

417
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,600
- Really? I don't remember that.
- Shocker.

418
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,020
So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.

419
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,314
Well, the company's not doing so hot.

420
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,775
- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.

421
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,154
Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.

422
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,866
It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.

423
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,744
How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.

424
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,538
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

425
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,916
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?

426
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,003
Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?

427
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
Because I'm good at it.

428
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,216
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.

429
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,844
Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.

430
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,847
I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.

431
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,309
But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?

432
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,729
I do love you, by the way.

433
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,357
I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.

434
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,486
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

435
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,450
Ta-da!

436
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:33,501
Well, it is truly...

437
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,338
how should I put this? Wonderful.

438
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,632
So you'll give Elefante a good review?

439
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,762
Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.

440
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,349
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.

441
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
At one point, a waiter
ran through the restaurant on fire.

442
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,356
Unfortunately,
you will be receiving my lowest rating:

443
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,026
four hundred and twelve stars,
out of a possible a billion.

444
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,194
A billion stars?

445
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,323
Yes, that's the rubric I use on
SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.

446
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,742
- Oh, God, get out.
- [exclaims]

447
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,453
I assure you the animated GIFs

448

with which I describe this encounter
shall be scathing.

449
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,669
Mom! I just touched base
with Rooney, re: Winslow.

450
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,172
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.

Perfect! This is the meeting
where we finally convince the big boys

to let us get babies addicted to vaping!

I don't think I can. I'm heading out.

I got pretty badly burnt earlier
and in a lot of pain.

458

I should probably go to the ER.

- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

And then what happened?

468
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,472
You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,

469
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,058
- and I needed to leave you alone.
- Oh.

I'm a real jerk, huh?

471
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,021
Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,

not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.

473

Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,

474
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:26,030
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.

You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.

You have great taste in art,

and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.

How many nice things was that,
about ten?

- Yeah, just about.
- Okay, one more.

You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.

You did it for me,
which was very sweet.

Are we friends?

Yeah. I mean, I think we are.

Or I think we can be.

I can turn this around,
I just need more time.

We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.

Just give me six months
and then you can go.

I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,
