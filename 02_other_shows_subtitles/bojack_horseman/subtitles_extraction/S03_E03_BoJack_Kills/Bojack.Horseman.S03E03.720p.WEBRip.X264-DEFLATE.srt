1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,803
What happened to my birthday cake?

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,680
- Goober.
- It wasn't me.

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,475
But you're welcome to check my pockets.

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,268
- Go home, Goober.
- Go home, Goober.

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,148
<i>Oh, I was a Goober, all right.</i>
<i>I Goobed with the best of 'em.</i>

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,942
But that ain't me anymore.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,821
I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/
number one customer of Whale World.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,282
At Whale World, families come together

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,286
to admire the fine female form
of the majestic killer whale.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,955
It's educational.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,623
<i>Join us in the Splash Zone.</i>

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,501
You and your little ones
are gonna get moist.

13
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,211
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>These orcas have the floppiest</i>
<i>dorsal fins in town</i>

15
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>and they can't wait to jump</i>
<i>through hoops for you and your kids.</i>

16
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,053
Bring your prepubescent daughters,

17
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,265
who are beginning to be cognizant
of a woman's role in the world.

18
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,976
They won't internalize
deeply problematic notions

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,104
about the commodification
of sexuality in today's society.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,398
What are you talking about?
It's just whales.

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,109
And what about so-called "experts,"

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,528
who say it's wrong
to keep these girls in captivity

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,280
so they can amuse and entertain us?

24
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,575
Well, to those people I say,
"Stop saying that, okay?"

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,828
These sea girls are my family,
and my business.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,162
And they can be yours too.

27
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:23,750
Come on down to Whale World,
a fun, sexy time for the whole family.

28
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>♪ ♪ </i>

29
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>♪ It is winter, yes, that's right ♪</i>

00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>♪ A time for family and lights ♪</i>

31
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,193
<i>♪ It doesn't mean God</i>
<i>And it doesn't mean pray ♪</i>

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,279

<i>But who are we to say? ♪</i>

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,366
- Hey, Jill.
- Where are you? I hear mirth.

34
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,912
An elementary school all inclusive
non-denominational winter day pageant.

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,667
Oh, no. The snow goblin wants to destroy
our seasonal festivities.

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,252
"Snow goblin" is an offensive slur.

37
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,463
Jesus, Jill.
And you thought your play sucked.

38
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,923
- I didn't.
- <i>Well, regardless.</i>

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,759
A lot of these fancy kids'
fancy parents are Oscar voters.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,136
If I wanna get nominated,
I got to rub elbows

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,639
and whatever the non-denominational
word for schmooze is.

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,642
Hobnob. Did you check
on Cuddlywhiskers like I asked?

43
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,019
He's doing great.
Little of this, little of that.

44
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,106
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,149
- You didn't check on him, did you?
- Completely forgot.

46
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,527
- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,988
Did you miss the three wise people make
their journey to visit the regular baby?

48
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,323
Go to his house.

49
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,826
If he's not there, you must retrieve
something for me,

50
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,620
something of a sensitive nature.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,666
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop
calling me, asking me to go on errands.

52
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,376
- What do you need?
- A letter I wrote him,

53
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,004
back when we were, prepare yourself,
I'm about to say lovers... Lovers.

54
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,299
- That was not enough time to prepare.
- Get off the phone, jerk.

55
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,677
It was years ago
and it was quite beautiful

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,222
and disgusting all at once.
I remember it fondly. And horribly.

57
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,975
- What's in the letter?
- None of your concern. I must have it,

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,729
for... sentimental reasons. Goodbye.

59
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,565
- Did you have a nice phone call?
- Are you in the Academy?

60
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,233
- No.
- Then I don't care what you think.

61
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,610
- I got to go do a thing for someone.
- Fine.

62
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,739
You made your appearance,
you were magnificent, I'm very proud.

63
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,742
But don't forget, you have a full day
of muckety-muck glad-handing.

64
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,870
The Bat Mitzvah,
the senior Academy member meet and greet.

65
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
You'll be wonderful,
I have complete faith in you.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,791
That is literally the first time
anyone ever said that to me.

67
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,793
Diane, you'll keep up
his Internet presence?

68
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,628
I want him trending by this afternoon.

69
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,631
But good trending, not bad trending,
you understand?

70
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,966
Hashtag you betcha.

71
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,553
Did I just say hashtag out loud?
Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!

72
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,139
I'm honestly more alarmed
by the "you betcha".

73
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,475
I'll take a smoke break
before these little boogers

74
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,436
dig into the refrain
of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person."

75
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,397
Ugh. Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.

76
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>I'm Terry Gross</i>
<i>and this is your ring tone.</i>

77
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,819
<i>I'm here with novelist Jonathan Lethem.</i>

78
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,821
<i>Jonathan,</i>
<i>how did you become a ring tone?</i>

79
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,823
<i>You know, Terry,</i>
<i>growing up in Brooklyn,</i>

80
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,952
<i>I was always fascinated by ring tones</i>
<i>and the stories they told.</i>

81
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,078
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

82
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,122
Hello, my precious darling
slice of sunshine,

83
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,082
who I am <i>not </i>putting on a pedestal.

84
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,168
Just calling for our daily download,

85
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,004
as per Dr. Janet's
friendly but firm suggestion.

86
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,672
When do you think you'll be home?

87
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,467
- Uh, it might be late.
- Okay, just let me know.

88
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,886
I cherish you, I respect you
and you have value.

89
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,806
I feel valued and I value you.

90
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,475
I am hearing that and I accept that.

91
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,393
- Diane?
- Yes?

92
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,770
<i>Do you accept my acceptance?</i>

93
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:17,275
I hear it and I accept it and I value it
and all the other verbs.

94
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,110
Promise you won't work too hard today?

95
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,864
I won't, if you promise me
you won't bother that skunk next door.

96
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,991
I don't want to come home
to a stinky husband.

97
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,537
That is some great food for thought.
I gotta go right now.

98
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,836
Mr. Peanutbutter,
my favorite weekday client.

99
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,171
- Why are you calling on the weekend?
- I need your help.

100
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,006
I've done something bad, very bad.

101
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,259
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

102
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,594
What? No, it's not. Why would I--

103
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,889
Listen, I was sniffing around
where I didn't belong and I got skunked.

104
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,266
- What?
<i>- You got to help us.</i>

105
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,559
- Us?
- Todd's here too.

106
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.
Skunked real bad.

107
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,981
Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,
super skunked.

108
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,817
- Hardcore.
- Yeah, hardcore skunked.

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,945
Okay. First things first,
don't go back in the house.

110
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,700
Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J
because I am in the house.

111
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,412
Yecch! Okay, don't move.
I'll be there in 20.

112
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,294
Mind if I do this real quick?
I gotta pick up a letter.

113
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,005
Can we make the appearances
we're supposed to make and go home?

114
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,464
Oh, sure.

115
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,634
I haven't seen you much
since you moved out of my deck chairs.

116
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,263
You know, I've been focusing
on my new job and my marriage and--

117
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,016
- And avoiding me?
- I'm not avoiding you.

118
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,477
I'm just making an effort
to not be in a room alone with you

119
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,898
- because I am... avoiding you.
- Oh.

120
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,068
You know, I think we're alike
in a lot of ways.

121
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,071
I always tell people
you're like the not-cool version of me.

122
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,573
Sometimes that's great,

123
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,618
but it also means we can bring out
the worst in each other.

124
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,536
I'm trying to get my life back on track.

125
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,080
I just think maybe it's better,
for both of us,

126
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,250
if we keep things
a little more professional.

127
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,710
Yes, okay. Professional.

128
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,672
BoJack and Diane being professional.
Doing our jobs and nothing else.

129
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,883
We're at the place I needed to go to.

130
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
It's so weird I drove here on accident.

131
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,596
Might as well run in
and grab that thing I need to get.

132
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,182
Then, back to business.

133
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,816
- It's spooky in here. Too spooky.
- Really?

134
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,987
And what would be the right amount
of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.

135
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,448
Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms
got so jacked.

136
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,699
Put it down, BoJack.

137
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,409
Does it look weird?
Me with an Oscar?

138
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,912
- I actually think that it feels--
- Oh, my God.

139
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,749
- I think she's dead.
- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.

140
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,378
Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?
No, she's dead.

141
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,004
Maybe there's someone
in her phone we can call.

142
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,839
Diane, kids these days don't call.

143
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,467
They communicate
via a combination of text messages,

144
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,719
- eye rolls, and dick pics.
- Oh, my God.

145
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,097
What is it? Dick pics?
See if they spell out a message.

146
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,182
Freeze! Drop the Oscar!

147
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,352
- Oh, man.
- Well, well, well.

148
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,356
Or should I say whale, whale, whale?
Killer whale, that is.

149
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,692
Or should I say <i>killed</i> whale?

150
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,777
- Listen, Officer--
- I told you to freeze.

151
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,656
You just became prime suspects
in the case I like to call,

152
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,160
"Black and White and Dead All Over,
A Whale Of A Crime:

153
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,539
An Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface Mystery."

154
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,540
Eh...

155
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,252
- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.
- I am a woman, sir.

156
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,170
Lindsay, you know I am trying.

157
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,007
Can we please show a united front
in front of the perps?

158
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,467
- We will talk about this later.
- Aww.

159
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,264
Ohh! It smells like a skunk
skunked another skunk in here,

160
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,307
then they smoked a joint.
What happened?

161
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,020
First I rolled all over the couch
to get the skunk stench out,

162
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,312
but that did not work.

163
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,442
Then I ran into every room to rub myself
on all my clothes and belongings,

164
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,569
to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

165
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,237
And then I smoked a joint,

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,823
so that might be
why it smells like skunk in here.

167
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,993
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this
before Diane gets home.

168
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,619
Things have been shaky with us

169
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,913
since she pretended
to be out of the country for two months.

170
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,832
And then when I filled our entire house

171
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,418
with these giant crates
of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

172
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,879
Why buy these spaghetti strainers
in the first place?

173
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,257
Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

174
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,301
Man, married life is weird.

175
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,054
We're making an effort
and getting stronger every day,

176
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,599
but I swear to God we are like five
big fights away from a divorce,

177
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,476
I do not want this to be one.

178
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,270
Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.

179
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,439
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

180
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
Is marinara all right,

181
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,776
or will I need something zestier
like Arrabiata?

182
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,612
Tomato bath.

183
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,821
Whoa!

184
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,909
I am so high right now.
Wait, was there a skunk in here?

185
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,666
- What do you know about Nadia?
- Uh, who's Nadia?

186
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,087
Your friend doing the face-down mambo
in the king-sized bathtub.

187
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,715
- Now I know her name is Nadia.
- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?

188
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,176
Although I am trying to branch
into more serious roles.

189
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,679
You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.

190
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,225
- Yeah, what are they?
- I mean, I don't <i>know them</i> know them.

191
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,229
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick?

192
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,189
You're not gonna look up your rights,
are you?

193
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,398
What? No.

194
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,733
I'm just supposed to moderate

195
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,361
an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback
on Snapchat.

196
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:18,118
Let me just set up
the user preferences here, and...

197
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,453
you can't detain us
unless we're under arrest.

198
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,206
Damn it. You <i>were </i>looking up
your rights, weren't you?

199
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,667
Nope, that was just a thing
I already knew.

200
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,003
Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.

201
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,507
- Let's get out of here.
- BoJack, I need to show you something.

202
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,008
This is Nadia's phone.

203
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,428
I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.

204
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,639
Check this out,
the last text message she sent.

205
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
"BoJack is going to kill me?"

206
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,310
I think someone's trying to frame you,
for murder.

207
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,565
Oh, my God, we're gonna be late
for the Bat Mitzvah.

208
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,941
We got to get to Brentwood.

209
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,403
At this time of day?
It's gonna be... murder.

210
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>

211
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,700
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>
Hey!

212
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,161
I can't believe
you're not more concerned about this.

213
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,497
- Someone is implicating you in a murder.
- I can be two things at once.

214
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,790
I am very concerned,

215
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,877
but also very proud
that today Tovah is a woman.

216
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Hi, BoJack Horseman,
potential Oscar nominee.

217
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,631
I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.

218
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.</i>

219
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,676
<i>- Shabbat shalom.</i>
<i>- Shabbat shalom</i> to you.

220
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,388
We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.

221
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,472
Good thinking.

222
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,976
If I go to jail, that will throw
a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.

223
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,020
The Academy does not look kindly
on murder.

224
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,855
Rape, they don't seem
to have a problem with.

225
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,691
Be careful. Jill could be the one
trying to set you up.

226
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,192
She did send us to the house.

227
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,571
Backstrom, turn it down a notch.
Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?

228
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,449
This is a crucial weekend
for BoJack brand awareness.

229
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,493
What am I supposed to tweet?
"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

230
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,246
- Hashtag murder party"?
- No, obviously.

231
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,791
Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.
Hashtag Jewish stuff.

232
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,002
- <i>BoJack.</i>
- Hey, Jill.

233
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,421
You're not trying to frame me
for murder, are you?

234
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,340
<i>- What?</i>
- Can you take this seriously?

235
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,883
Can you take <i>this </i>seriously?

236
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,886
You find the letter? Check in the vent
behind the water feeder.

237
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,513
I've been pretty tied up
at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.

238
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,682
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish?

239
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,852
I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up?
Get the letter.

240
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,355
This is why I couldn't live in New York.
Everyone's so bossy.

241
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,357
Also, what's with the pizza
by the slice thing?

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,567
Hey, New York,
either eat a pizza or don't.

243
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,779
I'm calling the last person
Nadia was in contact with before she died.

244
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,072
Maybe she knows something.

245
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
- <i> Nadia?</i>
- No, this is--

246
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,743
<i>Where you been? Boys upstairs</i>
<i>are getting real sick of you.</i>

247
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
<i>Get off the phone,</i>
<i>Skinny Gina. You're on the clock.</i>

248
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,205
<i>I gotta go.</i>

249
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,792
- That man's voice sounded familiar.
- Yeah, super familiar.

250
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,087
Something about that voice
made me want to tell it to go home.

251
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
- It's Goober.
- Goober.

252
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,715
That guy never went home.

253
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,634
Except for that one episode
"Goober Goes Home,"

254
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,636
because we were
on a softball team together

255
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,096
and the home was home plate.

256
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,889
They must be at Whale World.

257
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,309
Okay, good. Because I absolutely
want to get to the bottom of this.

258
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,853
Can we at least wait
until after they lift the chair?

259
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,398
- That is my favorite part.
- Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

260
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,443
Oh, I taste delicious.

261
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,529
How you boys doing in there?

262
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,115
- Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.
- Oh, no, the stain.

263
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,701
Me three.

264
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,327
You took your bath together?

265
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,915
Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends
and no one gives her shit.

266
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,958
Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

267
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,752
Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.
Do not shake.

268
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,963
- The sauce is so sticky and wet.
- Don't shake.

269
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,382
It's dripping all over my body.
I gotta shake!

270
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,384
- Aaah!
- Aah!

271
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,927
Oh, yeah.

272
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,723
Oh, look, that made things worse.

273
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,685
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.
You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

274
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,439
You got it, chief.
Hooray! Following instructions.

275
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,820
Ooh.

276
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,656
Fish half off at Beverly Hills
farmers market.

277
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,616
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

278
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,786
You're not putting emojis in, are you?
BoJack don't tweet emojis.

279
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,374
- BoJack? Oh, my God!
- Oh, hey... you.

280
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,917
I haven't seen you in forever.

281
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,837
- You came to see your old friend.
- Uh, yeah.

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,631
All this time
I thought you forgot about me.

283
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,509
Things haven't been so swell with me
since the show ended.

284
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,596
- Not like you, Mr. Movie Star.
- Okay, buddy.

285
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,389
Just knowing that you care about me

286
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,059
and would come patronize
my place of business,

287
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,227
- it really means a lot.
- You got it, Goober.

288
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,688
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober
for 20 years.

289
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,649
- You can call me by my real name.
- Okay, maybe I will.

290
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,319
Right now, call me by my real name.
I want to hear you.

291
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,528
Uh...

292
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,367
I want to say Goo... bert.
Goobert?

293
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,161
Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you?

294
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,081
- No, we did, but--
- I get it. I'm a big joke.

295
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,958
"Let's all go down to Whale World
and laugh at Goober.

296
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,711
We'll have a whale of a good time
at Goober's expense.

297
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,338
He's always good for a laugh."

298
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,799
I should've known better
than to get my hopes up.

299
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,716
Yeah.

300
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,052
We're looking for one of your strippers,
Skinny Gina?

301
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,098
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't employ strippers here.

302
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,350
Whale World is a family establishment,

303
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,478
where children of all ages
have a fun, sexy time.

304
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
Hey, Skinny Gina,
get that sweet tail over here!

305
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,274
You got a customer. You enjoy yourself.

306
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,486
Well, hello, land mammals.

307
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,280
We're just here to ask you some questions
about your friend Nadia.

308
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,907
I'm on the clock. You want to chat?

309
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,493
Buy me a private dance
in the Blowhole Room.

310
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,871
- Oh, please.
- Ugh, gross. Private dance?

311
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,457
But if that's the only way she'll talk,
then fine.

312
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,792
Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.

313
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,461
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.

314
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,921
But gross.

315
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,845
Oh, um, you can dance however
you want. Don't do this for my benefit.

316
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,182
Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.

317
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,726
- How would you dance then?
- Like a stripper, probably.

318
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,398
Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.

319
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,191
- Not surprised.
- You're not?

320
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,736
A lot of girls like her come through here.
Sweet, vulnerable.

321
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,990
This place takes 'em
and makes 'em a lot of promises.

322
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,034
They say they're gonna take care of you,
make you big like Shamu.

323
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,455
But once your body gets too banged up,
they don't want you no more.

324
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,750
- Thar she blows, then thar she goes.
- Shit.

325
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,794
Watch your mouth, lady.
There are children here.

326
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,962
Uh...

327
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,965
What do you know about Nadia's
relationship with Cuddlywhiskers?

328
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,925
Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

329
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,220
His house has been abandoned
for months, though. That's all I know.

330
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,972
- That's it?
- That's it.

331
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,016
A bunch of girls used to hang out.

332
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,186
He had some sort of system.
Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.

333
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,147
- What do you mean, "system"?
- I have already said too much.

334
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,774
A system is a formulated method
or plan of procedure.

335
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,236
- I know what the word "system" means--
- But that's all I can say.

336
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,781
That text that Nadia sent you,
"BoJack is going to kill me."

337
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,033
Any idea what that's about?

338
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,785
Hey, I don't know nothing about BoJack.

339
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,996
How do you not know about BoJack?
I am very famous.

340
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,247
Time's up.

341
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,877
Hey, if you really want to know
about all that stuff,

342
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,128
come by here real late.

343
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,881
There's an after-hours party.
But that's all I can say.

344
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

345
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,345
Say you got BoJack with you.
That'll get you in. Okay, that's it.

346
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,848
Is Wilbur coming today?

347
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,936
Wilbur's not real. He was a character
on a TV show you were on.

348
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,899
- Oh. Are my kids coming today?
- Um...

349
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,359
- No.
- Hey there, fella.

350
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,278
Can't wait for you to see <i>Secretariat,</i>
think you're gonna love it.

351
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,280
Hey, old pal.
Hope you remember how to vote.

352
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,533
We have to go
to this Whale World party.

353
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,952
I know I should go,
I'm invested in figuring out

354
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,453
who's trying to frame me for murder.

355
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,039
Are you sure you wanna go with me?
Outside of work hours?

356
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,916
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

357
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,584
Sorry about what I said.

358
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,754
I was embarrassed by the person I was
when I was staying with you.

359
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,381
I'm trying not to be that person.

360
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,758
I make you unhappy?
Is that what you're saying?

361
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,344
It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.

362
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm just trying to get through each day.

363
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,848
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"

364
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,350
It just makes me more miserable.

365
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,978
Can I get a photo with the star?

366
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,398
- Of course.
- Oh, thank you.

367
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't know if I believe in it,
real lasting happiness.

368
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,281
All those perky, well-adjusted people
you see in movies and TV shows?

369
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,284
- I don't think they exist.
- No one's happy all the time.

370
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,161
- You have to focus on the small things.
- Right.

371
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,414
- Like winning an Oscar.
- Right.

372
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, old pal.
Look at this guy, still alive.

373
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,793
Hope your voting finger works.

374
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,632
- What happened out here?
- You told us to get rid of the clothes.

375
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,261
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.
They're never coming back.

376
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,640
You two are impossible.
Why did you even call me here?

377
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,851
Because you're Princess Carolyn,
you can fix anything.

378
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,937
That's true.
But you can't start a fire on your lawn.

379
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,690
There's a drought and--
There's a drought.

380
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,485
You, thoughtful husband that you are,
got rid of your lawn,

381
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,697
and replaced it
with drought-resistant landscaping.

382
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,991
This could work.
I got to make a few phone calls.

383
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,743
Aw, thanks. You're the best.

384
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,329
I tell you, I've got half a mind
to go over

385
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,206
and give it to that skunk
for starting this whole darn thing.

386
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,085
No. You go inside to your spot
and stay there while I fix this.

387
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,630
- Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...
- Stay. Stay.

388
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,756
Stay.

389
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,759
Oh, my God.

390
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,676
Ugh.

391
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,262
- I, uh...
- Living the nightlife.

392
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,849
Hashtag feeling good about myself
and my choices.

393
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,481
Aah!

394
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,690
Hey, look.

395
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,071
Let's definitely follow that guy.

396
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,909
- Ladies first.
- What a gentleman.

397
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,411
Ohh.

398
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,209
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

399
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,752
Ohh. Oh, my God.

400
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,505
<i>I'm Terry Gross</i>
<i>and this is your ring tone.</i>

401

402
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,049
BoJack kills?

403
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,802
Something tells me that's not a reference
to your old stand-up act.

404
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
Was that necessary?

405
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,598
- What do you want?
- I'm with BoJack.

406
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,100
Yeah? Let me see.

407
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,228
- See what?
- Let me see some BoJack.

408
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,146
Fine.

409
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,524

411
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,405
- Oh, shit. You're BoJack!
- Thank you. Finally.

412
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,157
- From the logo.
- Huh?

413
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,704
BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.
BoJack did.

414
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,997
What?

415
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,833
Nighty-night.

416
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,131
Wakey, wakey.

417
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,299
So, you got a little curious, huh?

418
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,010
Thought you'd go sticking your little nose
where it doesn't belong?

419
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,805
What's the play here?
Trying to get a cut of my smack biz?

420
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,181
What? No, Goober.

421
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,350
- You know my real name.
- I actually seriously don't.

422
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,312
We just wanted to know why everyone
was talking about how BoJack kills?

423
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,606
Why would you implicate me
in your drug business?

424
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,108
Wait, I get what happened.

425
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,361
You resented me all these years.
My fame, your obscurity.

426
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,238
You made me the face of this drug,

427
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,576
because to you my face is a symbol
for the opiate of show business.

428
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,286
- No, man. You played The Horse.
- Huh?

429
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,121
- Horse is a nickname for heroin.
- What?

430
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,582
- BoJack. Horse. Heroin.
- Uh-huh. Uh...

431
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,001
Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

432
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,295
- Police!
- Oh, God, not again.

433
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,549
Gotcha!
Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.

434
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,801
- Oh, right, Reggie.
- Richie.

435
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,803
That's what I said. I said Rickie.

436
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,680
Thank God. How did you find us?

437
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,641
Your Twitter account is hooked up
to your phone's location services.

438
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,311
We've been tracking you
through your tweets all night.

439
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,271
Actually, I've been tracking you
all night.

440
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,357
Lindsay, I said "we".
Do you need credit for everything?

441
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,694
I would like credit for something.

442
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,112
What do we know?

443
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,698
Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.

444
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,826
No one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.

445
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,328
Look out, Jurj Clooners.

446
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,497
But something's still fishy
about this whole mess,

447
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,833
- and it's not just the killer whales.
- Whales are mammals, Diane.

448
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,878
- I said it's <i>not</i> the whales.
- You said it's not <i>just</i> the whales.

449
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,130
There's more to this story.
What are we missing?

450
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,425
Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia
doing in his backyard in the first place?

451
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,469
What was this "system"?
And where is he now?

452
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,347
Why was it so important to Jill
to get that letter back?

453
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,391
Oh, yeah, the letter.
This mystery has too many things.

454
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,270
I say we go back to the house and
finally get to the bottom of what's what.

455
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,314
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

456
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,234
A real Jill Pill jail fail
killer whale caper.

457
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,487
- You're doing 50 in a 35.
- Oh, God, you're right.

458
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,113
I feel so alive.

459
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,618
This letter is really graphic.

460
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,621
It's all about their magical nights
up at the Ojai property.

461
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Ojai property?

462
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,542
She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"?

463
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,502
Did you know Cuddlywhiskers
had an Ojai property?

464
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,754
Sure. He always loved
to disappear up there.

465
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,173
After our show got canceled,
he went there for six months.

466
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:25,302
It's funny, at the time no one knew
where he was and we got really worried.

467
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,555
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

468
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,932
Oh, you know what?

469
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,061
- I don't see him. Do you?
- Huh.

470
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,772
- <i>I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.</i>
- Shit.

471
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,773
Mr. Peanutbutter.

472
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
- Diane, where the hell are you?
- Ojai.

473
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,487
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,
all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

474
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,782
I'm so sorry. BoJack and I
were trying to find a killer and--

475
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,702
Oh, you're with BoJack still?
Well, that explains it. Of course.

476
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,371
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I understand and affirm your feeling--

477
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,331
I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.

478
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,959
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--
- No, stop.

479
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,962
You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening,

480
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,006
doesn't matter
if it's the middle of the night.

481
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,674
You can't keep doing this to me.

482
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

483
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,430
I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

484
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,267
- Everything okay?
- No.

485
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,769
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

486
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,313
It's my fault.

487
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,191
BoJack?

488
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,196
Mmm.

489
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,367
After <i>The BoJack Horseman Show</i>
fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

490
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,329
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,
I made a ton of money,

491
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,538
but it wasn't fulfilling.

492
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,416
I remember when I won my Oscar,
standing up on that stage,

493
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,917
looking at the statue and thought,

494
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,211
"This is supposed to be
the happiest moment of my life."

495
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,088
And I never felt more miserable.

496
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,592
- Oh. Because you're sober?
- Because an Oscar is meaningless.

497
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,845
It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.

498
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,765
I turned my home into a halfway house
for troubled addicts.

499
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,893
I had this system for recovery,
and it helped a lot of them,

500
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,062
but even more slipped through the cracks.

501
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,064
That, too, left me empty.

502
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,232
Everyone was worried about you,
you know.

503
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,319
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.

504
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,614
Sometimes you need to take responsibility
for your own happiness.

505
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,491
You don't think that's a little selfish?

506
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,952
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

507
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,537
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.

508
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,999
It takes a long time to realize
how truly miserable you are,

509
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,627
even longer to see
it doesn't have to be that way.

510
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:27,883
Only after you give up everything
can you begin to find a way to be happy.

511
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,061
Can you believe that guy?
What a nut, right?

512
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,938
I just wanna go home.
