A gloomy portent, precariously perched.

And, as the sun sets,
so does it spread its deathly shadow

across the just and unjust
of the outdoor seating area

Mm-hmm! And what better way
to view such disquieting omens

than through these gorgeous
floor-to-ceiling windows?

Yeah. Wow! They really make
regular windows look like shit.

Then, it became a safe space
for women and men.

00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,857
Oh!

168
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,860
Now, it's more
of a safe-ish space for women...

Mm-hmm.

and watch it slowly disappear
into nothingness.

178

But the sugar doesn't know why.
Sugar didn't ask to be born.

In a sense, yes.

198

But, in another sense,
I'm promoting you

199

to a position of finding a job
somewhere else.

You were the worst social media
coordinator this company ever had.

Are you sure you need surgery?
Can't you get a second opinion?

Second opinion? You know
there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

I could ask him twice
if it'd make you feel better.

Nothing could make me

00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,374
What back-up envelope?
There is no back-up envelope.

302
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,252
That was a test and you passed.

303
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>Wunderbar.</i>
Now, let's get you out there.

304
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:25,216
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage,
to announce the nominations.

305
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,052
Just as soon as I--
Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper?

306
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,513
Bradley Cooper?
We love him for some reason.

307
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
-Where?
-Let's go, Todd.

308
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
-Oh, God, what do we do?
-It's okay.

309
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,562
We just need to come up
with all the nominees ourselves.

310
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,605
But I haven't even seen all the movies.

311
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,358
Todd, nobody has.
That's not how they give out awards.

312
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,734
-But--
-Time for talk is over.

313
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,902
Now's the time for action.

314
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,989
And by "action," I mean
talking about these 24 categories

315
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,949
until we've settled on a list of nominees.

316
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,076
You need to tell me right now,
are you in or out?

317
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,619
Well, when you put it that way,

318
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,914
I guess you can call me
high-waisted denim,

319
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,834
because, right now, I am very in.

320
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,835
Let's do this.

321
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,296
What did you think of Frieda Pinto?

322
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,756
Are you kidding me?
Anybody could do what she did.

323
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,719
"Don't take my baby.
I'll give you all my Bitcoins!"

324
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,387
Wow. That is good.

325
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,348
Okay, for Best Picture,
what about <i>Avatar?</i>

326
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,852
-That was a good movie.
-True, but did that come out this year?

327
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,688
-I feel like I just saw it.
-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

328
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,981
Let's just throw it on the list.

329
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,485
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis
down for anything? He's always there.

330
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,903
Good catch! I'll add him.

331
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,029
Daniel Day-Lewis.

332
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,492
Okay. We need one more nominee
for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

333
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,244
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>
was as thoughtful and self-aware

334
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
as we've ever seen him.

335
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
-Besides, he's our friend.
-Is he?

336
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,001
Whoa! I am surprised to hear
you say that, Todd Chavez.

337
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,545
-Let's dig into that. We have time.
-I don't think we do.

338
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,589
You're supposed to be
announcing these, like, now.

339
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
There is always time
to talk about our feelings.

340
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,177
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

341
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,054
"There's always time
to talk about feelings,

342
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,556
because feelings
are the ceilings of our hearts,

343
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,392
and a leaky feeling ceiling
leads to a flood of blood.

344
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,520
And I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?"

345
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,899
Well, I guess I'm just tired
of BoJack walking all over everybody

346
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,652
and still getting everything he wants.

347
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,987
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think
the important thing to remember here

348
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,573
is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

349
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:16,911
struggling against a sea of demons,
many self-created, but still all too real.

350
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,747
Getting this nomination
from the two friends he loves the most--

351
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,500
you and also me--
would really mean a lot to him.

352
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,085
[sighs]
Okay.

353
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,337
But did you really think
he was that good in the movie?

354
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,048
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

355
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,469
And the final nominee
for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

356
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,681
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.

357
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,182
Goodbye. I must go.

358
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,309
[audience clamoring]

359
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,814
I gotta say, we picked
some top-notch noms.

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,731
You know it!

361
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,900
Boy, was I glad when we got
out of that theater, though.

362
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,902
I know. So many questions.

363
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,613
"Oh, what the hell happened?

364
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:57,785
Why were you reading off that napkin?
Why are you guys running?"

365
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,079
They have their nominees.
What more could they want?

366
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,999
You know what's crazy?
We saved the day today,

367
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,751
and no one will ever even know.

368
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,879
-Hey, we'll know.
-[doorbell rings]

369
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925
Mr. Peanutbutter, we know what you did.

370
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:13,926
Oh, boy.

371
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,347
So, the good news is,
my brother's surgery was a success.

372
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,725
And the bad news is,
you're not nominated for an Oscar.

373
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,435
And the other good news is...

374
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,145
[voice fading out]
...that each breath is a gift

375
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,980
and it is a joy to live.

376
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,816
-What?
-We are so lucky we get to be alive.

377
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,943
-No, before that.
-Oh, I didn't tell you.

378
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,904
-My brother's been sick.
-No, I don't care about your brother.

379
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,072
First of all, manners.

380
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,284
Second of all, I think if you met him,
you'd actually really hit it off.

381
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,037
Imagine me but with less
"in your face" cool guy attitude.

382
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,955
Did you say I'm not nominated
for an Oscar?

383
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,040
Oh...

384
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,791
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

385
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,336
but I feel like what everyone's
overlooking here is,

386
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,588
I got most of the categories dead-on.

387
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,341
That's pretty amazing, and I am not
getting enough credit for that.

388
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,843
Did you know
that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

389
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,012
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.
-No.

390
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,848
But you know what they say.
"It's an honor just to be nominated."

391
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,932
Oh, wait.

392
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,310
So, I'm just like everybody else.

393
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,313
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,
please don't get mad at Todd.

394
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,733
-Why would I get mad at Todd?
-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

395
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,610
-He didn't even want to nominate you.
-What?

396
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,819
With the gift of hindsight,

397
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,530
I see now how that might have
made you even more upset.

398
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,450
But I realized something today,
when my brother called from the hospital,

399
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,786
and I think it's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

400
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,164
-What? What is it?
-None of this matters.

401
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,124
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

402
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,585
[whistling]

403
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,422
[inaudible dialogue]

404
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,715
As a partner in the company,

405
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,176
I am prepared to forgo my salary
for the next three months,

406
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,637
but even then, we're going
to need some sort of miracle.

407
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,473
What are we doing?
What was the point of any of this?

408
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,101
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

409
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,062
Soon, I'll get some offer
from one of the big five agencies

410
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,647
that I can't say no to,

411
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,107
and I'll go back to being another cog

412
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,819
in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker
that is this industry.

413
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
-Is that the best I can hope for?
-Not necessarily.

414
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,824
Although, there is one thing
I should probably mention.

415
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,200
What is it, Judah?

416
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,205
Maybe this is an opportunity
to live one of your other eight lives.

417
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,375
Yeah, maybe.

418
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Judah.

419
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,213
I found it to be
an above average experience.

420
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,799
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

421
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,300
[sighs]

422
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,266
[Southern accent]
Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

423
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,268
Can I get it on stale?

424
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,730
And then, he said,
I fetishize my own sadness.

425
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,482
[laughing] What did you think was
gonna happen? Why did you go there?

426
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,734
I don't know.

427
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,652
-Did you ask for water?
-No.

428
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,113
They're not supposed to give us water
unless we ask.

429
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,241
-Don't they know there's a drought?
-You want to send the water back?

430
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,160
No, I want the water. I just...

431
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,704
I went to BoJack's house
to congratulate him.

432
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,164
I'm not trying to pick fights.

433
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,583
Well, you don't have to see him at all
if you don't want to.

434
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,334
It's not like you work for him anymore.

435
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,546
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?
-Who cares what he thinks?

436
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,507
Why do you have
this weird fixation with him?

437
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,261
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.
I worry about him.

438
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,512
Okay. And last year?

439
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,973
When you came back from Cordovia
and needed a place to crash?

440
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, you could have stayed with me,
or any of your other friends,

441
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,186
but you went right to his house.

442
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,730
Did you ever ask yourself why?

443
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,358
They're filling everyone's glasses.
This is insane.

444
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,694
Oh, my God. What do you care?

445
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,362
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

446
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,491
Do you know you're breaking the law
by giving everybody water?

447
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,742
It's okay. I want the water.

448
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,912
Yeah, we all want water.
That's not the point.

449
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,956
In the state of California,
it is illegal for a restaurant

450
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,793
to serve people water
before they ask for it.

451
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,921
There is a drought.

452
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,714
Sit down! We're thirsty!

453
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,759
[scoffs] You know,
this is what's wrong with society.

454
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,718
Diane...

455
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,763
Nobody thinks about the world
outside themselves.

456
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,518
So, how you doing?
You still working at that place?

457
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,479
[line ringing]

458
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,065
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

459
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,235
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>
<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

460
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,986
I might have some free time coming up.

461
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,155
I was wondering
if you might want to get a drink.

462
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>
<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

463
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,494
Okay?

464
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>
<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

465
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>-this woman...</i>
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

466
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,250
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>
<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

467
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,168
<i>-and tumbled into my arms.</i>
-[Carolyn] <i>What?</i>

468
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,171
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>
<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

469
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,924
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>
<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

470
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,175
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>
-I moved to Russia,

471
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,385
and I'm totally messing with you.

472
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,553
-None of that's true.
-<i>What?</i>

473
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,763
I would love to see you again.
I think about you all the time.

474
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,683
-Really? [chuckles]
<i>-Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

475
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,809
It's a date.

476
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,607
-[metal clattering]
-Ana?

477
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,111
Uh, no, it's just me,
giant chocolate Oscar guy.

478
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,363
I'm here to pick up
the giant chocolate Oscar.

479
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:49,034
My boss really wants our product
to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

480
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,870
You know, to maintain the integrity
of the giant chocolate Oscar.

481
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,706
I don't care. Take it.

482
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,709
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

483
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>How did you get this number?</i>
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

484
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,964
-[line beeps]
-Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

485
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,049
Please call me back. I need you.

486
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:08,012
Ana, please.
This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

487
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,390
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

488
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,017
-Oh, hi.
-You were in Ojai?

489
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,061
-No, I was just saying hi.
-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

490
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,272
You and me?
I could use an escape, couldn't you?

491
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
It's not really a good time.

492
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,484
Todd, I need this.
You're my best friend and I need you.

493
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,945
Don't leave me now.
Don't be like everybody else.

494
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,614
I'm not leaving you. I just--

495
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,367
Besides, I think you owe me, right?
After what you did?

496
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,494
-What I did?
-Come on, Todd. I know.

497
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,247
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.
-Everything?

498
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,834
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used
to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

499
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,794
-when I got out of the bath?
-What?

500
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,589
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

501
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,051
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>
<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

502
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,470
Mm, no, not-not about that.

503
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,472
So, he didn't tell you everything.

504
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,724
Did he tell you about the time
I counted to a million?

505
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:58,312
One, two, three, four, five, six--

506
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,023
-No, stop.
-But I was just getting to the good part!

507
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,693
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want
to nominate me for an Oscar.

508
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,445
-Oh, that.
-What the hell, man?

509
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,656
-After everything I've done for you?
-What are you talking about?

510
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,533
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here
for free for six years?

511
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,244
Giving you food, indulging you
in your little projects and adventures

512
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,164
and stories about how you used to bang
on your butt like a bongo drum?

513
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,332
I let you turn my house

514
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,917
into your company's headquarters
for the last month.

515
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,877
Yeah, but that's not
because you're my friend.

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,089
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.
-You know about Emily?

517
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,467
I think I know.
Why? What do you think I know?

518
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,802
I mean, I know what I think,

519
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,681
but I don't know if the thing that I think
is the thing that you think I know.

520
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,141
-You know?
-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

521
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,477
You had sex with Emily?!

522
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,105
-Well, what did you think?
-I don't know! Not that!

523
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,940
I just knew something sketchy happened.

524
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,234
I thought maybe you gave her
one of your weird monologues

525
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,527
about how sad you are,

526
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,611
and it bummed her out!

527
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,988
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?
I screwed up.

528
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:54,159
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--
-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

529
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,828
You can't keep doing this!

530
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,581
You can't keep doing shitty things,
and then feel bad about yourself

531
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,417
like that makes it okay!

532
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,919
You need to be better!

533
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,713
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

534
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,758
I was drunk, and there was all this
pressure with the Oscar campaign.

535
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:15,139
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--
-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

536
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,016
You are all the things
that are wrong with you.

537
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,269
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

538
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,272
or any of the shitty things
that happened to you in your career,

539
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,523
or when you were a kid.

540
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
It's you.

541
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,903
All right? It's you.

542
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,535
