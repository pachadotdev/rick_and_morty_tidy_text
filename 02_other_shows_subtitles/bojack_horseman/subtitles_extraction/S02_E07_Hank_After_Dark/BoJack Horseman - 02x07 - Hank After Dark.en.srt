1
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:14,248
Thank you, Billy Crystal, for
that impression of a black person.

2
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:17,627
- I'm Scott Wolf.
- And I'm Matthew Fox.

3
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:19,637
We may be a group of five on TV,

4
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,389
but any of these next
nominees would be welcome

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,634
to join our party any day.

6
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:31,182
The nominees for Male Animal in a
Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are:

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,101
BoJack Horseman, Horsin' Around.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,355
Now that's what I call horsin' around.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,781
Uh... Yeah.

10
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:43,277
Mr. Peanutbutter, Mr.
Peanutbutter's House.

11
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:46,615
Now that's what I call doggin' around.

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,585
And finally, my personal favorite,

13
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:55,289
Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark!

14
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:58,509
Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.

15
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:02,129
Hiya!

16
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:04,473
And the animals' choice is...

17
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:06,808
Hank Hippopopalous, Hank After Dark!

18
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:08,727
Oh, yeah.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,106
No, no, no, no. It's
because we're on a show

20
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:16,018
called Party of Five. Get it?

21
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:18,103
Hey, buddy, pass me
that bottle of vodka?

22
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:21,273
- That's not really how this works.
- It's open bar, don't be a dick.

23
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,651
- BoJack Horseman?
- Do I know you?

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,695
This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.

25
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:28,614
- Katrina, BoJack.
- I don't watch TV.

26
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,791
Can I get another drink now or will
that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

27
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,664
- Uh, uh, no, I would never be...
- Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

28
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,583
My friends told me to get a prenup,

29
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:42,044
but I was like, "Hey,
marriage lasts forever."

30
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:43,880
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

31
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:46,006
Can you believe two guys like us

32
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:49,719
were even in the same
category as Hank Hippopopalous?

33
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:51,136
That's Uncle Hanky.

34
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,097
Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."

35
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,808
I'm BoJack Horseman.

36
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:58,402
You're just some other guy I'll
probably never talk to again.

37
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:01,988
Hey, boys. What is this,
a crossover episode?

38
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,985
That is the funniest
thing I have ever heard.

39
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,196
Uncle Hanky. Sir, I am your biggest fan.

40
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:12,199
I used to watch Hank
Hippopopalous's Dance-Pop Cosmopolis

41
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,701
every day after school.

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,788
- Hey, can I get a picture with you?
- Of course, kid.

43
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:21,459
Here, let me advance this.
And we probably got it.

44
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,218
And we'll find out in four to six weeks.

45
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,545
Yeah, I can't wait.

46
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,839
Okay, I gotta go. My
wife's hand just disappeared

47
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,257
into that busboy's pants.

48
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,594
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

49
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:32,929
Hey, kid, listen.

50
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,597
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

51
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:37,558
I've seen your show.
You're really funny.

52
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,269
- Yeah?
- Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,021
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

54
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,989
That's just the way it is.

55
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,859
Oh.

56
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,362
This suit needs more flasks.

57
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,891
- Diane!
- Aah!

58
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:57,304
Will you bring me one of
those big Toblerone bars?

59
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:00,767
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.

60
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:04,478
Yes, I know, but I always forget
to write these things down.

61
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:06,439
Tell me, how's your little movie?

62
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,734
Actually one of the stars
just died. It's really sad.

63
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:12,277
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

64
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,947
Yeah, well, that's a real
tragedy. Meanwhile, Diane,

65
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,409
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.

66
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,285
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

67
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,915
Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

68
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, now the production's on hiatus

69
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,919
so BoJack and I are going on a book tour

70
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,880
to promote the new paperback
edition of One Trick Pony.

71
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,423
Please get here soon, Diane.

72
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:38,220
The people of Cordovia need
you and I need that Toblerone.

73
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,972
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

74
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,600
You need to be on your
best behavior for this tour.

75
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:45,227
Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script

76
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:47,063
and get a lot of people mad at you.

77
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,940
What? I don't do that.

78
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:49,989
You're a movie star now.

79
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,611
Any bad press you get
can hurt Secretariat.

80
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,739
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.

81
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,699
Please. We're going to Alaska.

82
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,660
How am I gonna offend a bunch of
inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

83
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,163
You're right. What was I thinking?

84
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,297
The Republic of Cordovia's Prince Gustav

85
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,126
visiting Los Angeles this week

86
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,295
while his country rests
on the brink of civil war.

87
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,297
Prince Gustav is a ruthless despot,

88
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,341
but I'd still rather share a
bed with him than my ex-wife.

89
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,677
Shannon, I didn't mean that.

90
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,351
Listen. With Hey, I Think
You Can Dance as a lead-in,

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,028
we are expecting big things for
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

92
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,489
What Do They Know? Do They
Know Things? Let's Find Out,

93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,570
or H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.
for short.

94
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,329
- Mm.
- Why don't we get Hank in here?

95
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,199
You guys can get some pictures together.

96
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,826
Hank is coming here?

97
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,203
That old guy from Hey,
I Think You Can Dance?

98
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,747
- What's the big deal?
- You don't understand.

99
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:49,917
When I was a kid, this guy was the guy.

100
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:53,671
I even bought his novelty rap album, The
Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.

101
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,881
You shouldn't meet your
hero on an empty stomach.

102
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,891
- Want me to go get you some chili?
- Good call.

103
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,551
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,221
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

105
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,307
- Hank Hippopopalous.
- Oh, we've met.

106
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,853
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

107
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,562
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

108
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,113
you guys could stand back to back.

109
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:14,233
And then on the billboard it'll say:

110
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:19,446
"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are
back to back. Thursdays on MBN."

111
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:22,040
So, what should I do
with my arms? Like akimbo?

112
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,416
- You're fine.
- Reverse akimbo?

113
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,585
- No, that...
- King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

114
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,746
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.

115
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,581
- Can't stop windmilling now.
- Hey, hey.

116
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,292
Why don't we just do what feels natural?

117
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,294
Guys like us? We're pros.

118
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:35,629
"Guys like us"?

119
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,422
You think I'm a guy like us?

120
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,842
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.

121
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,677
Excuse me, would you
get a picture of us?

122
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:44,138
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

123
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,767
Now we open the floor to
questions from the audience.

124
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:53,522
BoJack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.

125
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:55,233
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,407
So, my question is:

127
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:58,986
Do you think Israel has
a right to defend herself?

128
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:00,704
- Uh...
- And what part should the U.S. play

129
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:01,739
as an ally?

130
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,409
Well, the thing about that...

131
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,998
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.

132
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,709
I mean, obviously there's no
panacea, but a two-state solution

133
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:16,678
with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

134
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:20,424
- Brilliant insight.
- Very good.

135
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,600
- My question is for Diane Nyu... Nyu...
- Oh.

136
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,769
- Nyu...
- You won't get it. Ask the question.

137
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,521
Your book went to some revealing places.

138
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,349
Were you worried at all that it
would hurt BoJack or his career?

139
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,726
That's a great question.

140
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,104
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

141
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:37,024
Well, I think the truth is
worth pursuing, no matter what.

142
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,401
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities

143
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,821
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.

144
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,365
- Like who?
- I don't know, like Mike Tyson

145
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:50,454
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

146
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,291
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

147
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,834
Wait, wait, what about
Hank Hippopopalous?

148
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,929
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

149
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,431
- I feel like we're getting off track.
- Do you not know that?

150
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,059
Any questions about me, the
handsome, famous horse with a book?

151
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,844
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

152
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,854
I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.

153
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,474
You can just Google "Hank
Hippopopalous allegations" and I...

154
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:12,191
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

155
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,145
Dear God.

156
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,358
Stanky Hanky? Allegations
vile and ranky.

157
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:21,319
But first, the visiting
Cordovian Prince Gustav

158
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,195
went missing briefly this afternoon,

159
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,698
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.

160
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:31,203
His official statement was, "Uh,
yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

161
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,372
Hooray, being a prince."

162
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,541
Our main story, ominous
and anomalous accusations

163
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,294
against Hank Hippopopalous.

164
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,296
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

165
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,840
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?

166
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,883
Joining me now is
Hippopopalous apologist

167
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,469
and armchair sociologist,
Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

168
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:48,929
what are these allegations?

169
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,974
These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV

170
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,851
or I'll sound like a crazy person.

171
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,478
What I want to know is why
we're letting a national treasure

172
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:59,731
face the same kind of smear
tactics used by the Viet Cong.

173
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,616
Are you calling attention to the fact

174
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:04,362
that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

175
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:06,905
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

176
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,001
You gotta see this set they're building!

177
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,703
There's a giant replica of my head,

178
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,497
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,

179
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:18,750
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

180
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,003
We're bringing class back to primetime.

181
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,547
- Sounds amazing.
- And I'm really getting along

182
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:24,923
with J.D. Salinger.

183
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,219
- Did you know we both hate phonies?
- I did know that.

184
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:31,513
So... listen. Some website
called "Tit Puncher"

185
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:35,017
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.

186
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,652
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter, I
didn't mean for that to happen.

187
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:40,772
Hey, do me a favor. Please don't
make a big thing out of this.

188
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:43,901
It's really not a good time, you
know, with my show about to launch.

189
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,196
- Hey, we are on the same page.
- Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

190
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,114
Because you should
not read the comments.

191
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,832
Believe me, nothing
would make me happier

192
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,868
than for this to just go away.

193
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,879
- Great. I love you, too.
- Hello.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,964
- Oh, my God!
- Is chili you ask for.

195
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,875
I am peasant boy Todd from village.

196
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:03,587
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover
of federated American states.

197
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:06,757
No reason for suspicions. Come on!

198
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:10,135
Wait a second, something's different.

199
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:12,930
I am... digging this new cologne!

200
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,806
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

201
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,227
Is so great to be in meager
trash city Los Angeles

202
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,979
with no pressures of royal life.

203
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,316
What? Royal life? Why
I'm saying? I am no royal.

204
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,943
Look at me. Normals.

205
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:29,321
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.

206
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,906
I'd know it anywhere.

207
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,579
- We will now begin our Q and A.
- Fire when ready.

208
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:40,833
What you got against Uncle
Hanky, you uppity cooze?

209
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,460
Diane, I believe this
question is for you.

210
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,548
If anyone here has any
questions about the book,

211
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:46,004
I'd be happy to answer those.

212
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,222
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

213
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,758
Golden-Globe winning star of the book.

214
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:53,471
If Hank did anything wrong, they
wouldn't let him on TV, right?

215
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,479
I'm really not here to talk about that.

216
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,433
You women are all the same.

217
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,184
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you make these

218
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,274
broad accusations to get
attention for yourself,

219
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,648
and when you don't have proof to
back it up, you just slink away.

220
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,191
I'm not slinking away.

221
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,152
I just wanted to say one thing about me.

222
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,405
I text and drive like
all the time. What?

223
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:14,749
Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,

224
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,577
and they don't even care they
could be ruining a man's life.

225
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:20,205
What? They ruined his life?

226
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,216
- You should probably just drop this.
- Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

227
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,336
They don't even know how
much I'm gonna drop it.

228
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,879
The way you said that made it
sound like you won't drop it.

229
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,765
How dare you spread a narrative that...

230
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,176
Don't tell me what to spread.

231
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:35,346
I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.

232
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:37,556
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

233
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,316
- This is completely...
- Yeah, hi.

234
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,018
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

235
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:44,021
I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,

236
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,606
like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor

237
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:48,192
that children are just better at.

238
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,826
You ever try to fit into a mine shaft?

239
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,863
That is a tight squeeze. What?

240
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,290
Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?

241
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,833
I'm so incorrigible.

242
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,453
Everyone's paying attention to me now!

243
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,246
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

244
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,541
Anyone else want a snack?

245
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:07,127
No? That's a no? On the snacks? Okay.

246
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:09,053
What do you have against
Hank Hippopopalous?

247
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:11,306
Everyone says he's a really nice guy.

248
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,383
Good point.

249
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,552
That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,

250
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,811
people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things

251
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,305
so they let him off the hook.

252
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:21,433
We don't know what happened. It's
a classic "he said, she said."

253
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,944
"He said, they said."
It's eight different women.

254
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,482
- Are they all lying?
- I mean, probably. We do that.

255
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,650
At this point, we just
don't know enough to judge.

256
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,278
Who are these women? Have
they ever shoplifted perhaps?

257
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,530
Do they wear short shorts?

258
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,907
Do they drink alcohol? All
these things are possible.

259
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,576
We don't know the facts.

260
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,202
See, this is part of the problem.

261
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,669
You're supposed to be a journalist.

262
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,164
You won't even tell your
audience what he's accused of.

263
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,882
You're an expert. Why don't you tell us?

264
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:47,209
I'm not afraid to say it.

265
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:50,003
Eight different women,
all former assistants,

266
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,839
claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a...

267
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,258
What is Diane doing?

268
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:57,344
I know. It's supposed to be my
book tour and she's upstaging me.

269
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:58,978
Like how it was supposed to be my book.

270
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,931
Actually, this might
be a thing she does.

271
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,857
She knows that Hippopopalous
is the only thing

272
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,768
keeping my network afloat, right?

273
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:07,020
The same network that
employs her husband.

274
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,564
Why would she do this?

275
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,448
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy

276
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,444
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!

277
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,413
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,

278
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,365
it can bring along its
dumb friend honeydew?

279
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:20,409
You don't get a plus-one, cantaloupe!

280
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:21,785
You need to talk to her.

281
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:23,745
Huh.

282
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,298
Wanda, I just got back from a
set visit on Contemporary Family.

283
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,584
It's a disaster!

284
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,427
- What?
- The kids have gone through puberty.

285
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,762
They are rubbing
themselves on everything.

286
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:35,591
If it isn't one thing,
it's ano... Just get a hose!

287
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:45,066
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail
for you like real American Johnny.

288
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,185
- Hey, man.
- Whoa!

289
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,063
You know it's a federal crime to
go through someone else's mail?

290
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:55,777
I do not know your customs, for
I am dirt-poor servant child.

291
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:58,614
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.

292
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:02,200
Death threat for wife, death threat
for wife, once more death threat,

293
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,787
and here many monies
off for Bed Bath Beyond.

294
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:09,082
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

295
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,925
Good Lord, that's graphic.

296
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,885
How would she even fit
one of those in there?

297
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,714
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.

298
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:21,178
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man?
This wife, she poke bear, yes?

299
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,347
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

300
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:27,017
They have a saying where
I am from, which is here.

301
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,019
Bear not like to be poke.

302
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:31,522
- Bear get angry...
- Right.

303
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,525
and destroy peasant rebel army

304
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:39,404
with fist of fire of which
make many, many nightmares

305
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:41,532
to children and men!

306
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,285
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.

307
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:47,245
Please don't ever change.

308
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:52,675
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with... Oh, I don't know.

309
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,419
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

310
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,463
Diane? I want you to
meet Amanda Hannity,

311
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,465
editor-in-chief here at Manatee Fair.

312
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,676
The pleasure's yours. Walk
with me, squawk with me.

313
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:03,894
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

314
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:06,557
but damn if she doesn't get shit done.

315
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,808
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

316
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:12,271
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an expos on Hank Hippopopalous.

317
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,272
I would love to take down Hippopopalous

318
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,283
and finally topple the
acropolis of monstrous hypocrisy

319
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,443
that ensconces us.

320
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,446
Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?

321
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,824
Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.

322
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:29,287
Amanda, I am so glad you're
throwing your weight behind this.

323
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,255
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- That dress is hideous.

324
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,957
Go home, burn it and come back.

325
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,210
When we know what we know
about a monster like that

326
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:36,844
and we still put him on TV every week,

327
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,971
we're teaching a generation
of young boys and girls

328
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,924
that a man's reputation
is more important

329
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,926
than the lives of the women he's ruined.

330
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,727
Yes, exactly! I feel
like I've been alone

331
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:47,723
in a crazy alternate
universe these last few days.

332
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,433
Well, you know I got your back, right?

333
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:52,436
We women have got to stick
to... Hey, fruit plate.

334
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,439
No, people don't want articles
about that. People want life-hacks.

335
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,524
Diane, you need to be strong.

336
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:01,111
Everyone is gunning for you. You're a
woman talking out of turn about a man.

337
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,740
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

338
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,867
No, this model doesn't look as pretty
as the other one. Can we kill it?

339
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,579
Scarves, not just for necks anymo...

340
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,791
We need to sit you down with someone
who's willing to go on the record.

341
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:16,800
I already reached out to all eight
of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

342
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,303
- What about his current assistant?
- You think she'd talk?

343
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,389
I don't know. What do you
think, answering machine?

344
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:27,011
Hi, my name's Nicole. I work
for Mr. Hippopopalous and, um...

345
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,021
I really need to talk to someone.

346
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,436
Are you kidding me? With
this honeydew right now? Ugh!

347
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,448
- Nicole?
- Mm-hm.

348
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,994
Hello, Diane.

349
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:54,247
Thank you, Nicole.

350
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,006
Prince Gustav today startled
the international community

351
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,925
when he gave his royal
fortune to charity.

352
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,719
What? Oh, no!

353
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,647
And fired his chief advisor, who
can be seen in this file photo

354
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,474
looking vaguely suspicious.

355
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,725
Oh, you idiot! No!

356
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,935
Big reforms which could
lead to sweeping change

357
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:19,981
in the embattled region, or a
precipitous economic collapse.

358
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:26,697
But back to our main story,
what is Diane's problem?

359
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,409
I'll say it once, for your article.

360
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:36,874
I didn't do any of those things
that you're accusing me of.

361
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,042
I wanna be very clear.

362
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,628
I'm not meeting you here
because I'm scared of you.

363
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:43,254
This is me doing you a favor.

364
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,965
- I think you are scared of me.
- I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

365
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,634
and I truly do believe that.

366
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:49,226
Twenty-four hours from now,

367
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:52,347
the news cycle will move
on to something else.

368
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,140
I'll go back to hosting my dance show,

369
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,519
which employs hundreds of
nice, good, hardworking people.

370
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:01,022
You, on the other hand,
are pretty much done.

371
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,025
People love me and they're
not gonna forgive you for this.

372
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,319
- This isn't about me.
- If you keep pushing this,

373
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,113
you're gonna drag down
the people close to you.

374
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,908
Look, you had your fun.

375
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,202
So, why don't you call it a
day and go home to your husband?

376
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,453
I know who you are.

377
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,248
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.

378
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:20,876
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.

379
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,252
Who the hell are you?

380
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,562
- So, you got nothing.
- I'm not giving up.

381
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,188
There's gotta be someone who will talk.

382
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:37,316
Oh, listen. I had a
conversation with my bosses

383
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,319
at AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

384
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,155
Toyota-Trader Joe's, and we agreed

385
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,158
these kind of stories,
they don't sell magazines.

386
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,537
- Are you seriously killing this?
- It's just not a good time.

387
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:51,539
So, this has nothing to do with the fact

388
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,915
that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-

389
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,919
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-
Trader Joe's also owns MBN,

390
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,757
and is currently profiting off of
Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?

391
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,258
I know you're upset.

392
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:03,467
Would you like a Joe-Joe?

393
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,844
It's just like an Oreo,
but Trader Joe's style.

394
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,764
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

395
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,390
Because you're mad at me, right?

396
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:13,052
Not because Joe-Joes
taste like garbage?

397
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,609
So, help me to understand...

398
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,487
Dog friend's program is to
find what celebrities know?

399
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,989
- Yep.
- So, is torture?

400
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,743
We don't torture
people in America, Todd.

401
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,911
That's called one of the amendments.

402
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,663
No, of course.

403
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:35,909
In America, you do not know to suffer.

404
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,712
You eat your cheesy pizza,
you drink your Ade of gator.

405
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:43,966
This life is nice for
visit but no way for live.

406
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,719
I go now. Back to palace!

407
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:51,090
Sounds great, Todd. See you tomorrow.

408
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,271
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh?

409
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:59,315
No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

410
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:00,316
Hey, Diane!

411
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:02,610
Why don't you shut
your stupid ugly face?!

412
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:03,944
Don't you talk to her like that!

413
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,863
Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.

414
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,325
I say you should shut
your stupid pretty face.

415
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:13,162
- This is not over. When people hear what...
- Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

416
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:15,623
- How could you say that?
- What are you doing here?

417
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,875
I mean, what is your
endgame in all of this?

418
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:22,171
You don't actually believe
Hank's innocent, do you?

419
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,298
Of course not, but that doesn't matter.

420
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,800
You're not gonna beat this guy.

421
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,717
I...

422
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,303
- What?
- Todd?

423
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:31,514
BoJack! Thank God you found me.

424
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,223
I thought I would never see you again.

425
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:37,269
- We're in the middle of something.
- I got mixed up in some bad stuff

426
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,315
and a genocide may or may not
have been perpetrated in my name.

427
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:42,941
Maybe you heard about it on the news?

428
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,821
No, most of the news has been
about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

429
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,365
What? Why? This is really serious.

430
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:50,908
Oh, of course your thing is serious

431
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,327
and my thing is just a dumb
feminist trying to get attention

432
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,579
by attacking a famous man, is that it?

433
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,122
Uh, what? No.

434
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,291
- Eat shit, Diane!
- You eat shit!

435
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,794
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't
know what you're talking about.

436
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,630
He spent the last few days at
Burning Man or whatever getting high.

437
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,549
No! That's not what happened at all.

438
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,843
A stranger just told me to eat shit.

439
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,345
I don't understand why you
can't be on my side about this.

440
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:12,429
I am on your side.

441
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,973
And I'm telling you you're
not gonna win this thing.

442
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,561
Also, P.S., when have
you ever been on my side?

443
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,688
- I am always on your side.
- Really?

444
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,566
Like when you wrote that book?
Was that you being on my side?

445
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,401
You're not still mad about the book.

446
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,904
You manipulated me and
completely took advantage of...

447
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,280
Guys? There is a very fragile alliance

448
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,616
between the Cords and the Ovians.

449
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:33,743
If we don't do something...

450
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,578
- Todd, nobody cares.
- Nobody cares, Todd.

451
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,247
Everything I did was to
help you tell the story

452
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:40,784
I knew you wanted to tell.

453
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,919
You got everything you
wanted because of that book.

454
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,838
You were a joke, now
people take you seriously.

455
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,883
You were out of work, now
you got your dream role.

456
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,300
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

457
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:54,346
But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.

458
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,474
And it's weird that you
never apologized for that...

459
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:58,642
and that you still won't.

460
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:03,014
Well... I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

461
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:07,818
- Are you?
- Yes, actually. I am.

462
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,111
I didn't want to do that

463
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,781
and I probably could have
handled things better.

464
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:15,986
I definitely should have. I'm sorry.

465
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,036
Okay.

466
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,663
But this is bigger than you and me.

467
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:23,576
And I need you in my corner now
because I don't have anybody else.

468
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:27,337
Well, okay.

469
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,916
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

470
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,926
I'm in your corner.

471
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:37,014
Guys, earlier, some general
asked me if it was "a go"

472
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:38,891
...on "that thing we talked about"?

473
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:43,145
And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.

474
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:46,057
Now I'm not sure that
was the right answer.

475
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,109
So, then I called Wayne to see

476
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,528
if I could write a story for
Buzzfeed. Here's the good news:

477
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:52,905
They'll publish anything.

478
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,824
Hey, um...

479
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,116
Can I talk to you?

480
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:57,576
Yeah, of course. What's up?

481
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:03,248
I asked you, really nicely, not
to make a big thing out of this.

482
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:07,586
- Yeah, I know, but someone...
- Had to say something, right?

483
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,213
And that someone had to be you?

484
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,382
Because... why?

485
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:14,217
I really don't get it.

486
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:17,972
What is accomplished by you being
the one to take a stand on this?

487
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:19,515
Uh...

488
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:20,683
Mr. Peanutbutter...

489
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:23,727
This game show is a
really big deal for me.

490
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:27,189
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.

491
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,109
But I need this to go
well, and I can't...

492
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,486
Those are death threats.

493
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:34,571
People want to murder my wife

494
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:36,365
because of what she's saying on the news

495
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:39,535
about something that she
has nothing to do with.

496
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,287
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

497
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,456
- Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
- Oh.

498
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:49,370
God, you know, you'd
almost be safer in Cordovia.

499
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,380
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

500
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,256
I'm obviously not
making a difference here.

501
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,592
Actually, maybe you should.

502
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,963
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.

503
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:04,135
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

504
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:08,056
You don't really want me to go, do you?

505
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:11,475
Why does it suddenly matter what I want?

506
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:21,493
Flight 57, Cordovian
Airlines, now boarding.

507
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,621
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it?

508
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:25,789
No, I did not.

509
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,500
Well, that's good enough for me.

510
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:33,372
Coming up, Kanye West claims to hate
Thin Mints. Our panel is outraged.

511
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,133
Hating Thin Mints? Is he legally insane?

512
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:38,719
You can bet we'll get into
this further in the next hour.

513
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,923
This is the only thing I care about now.

514
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,467
Hey.

515
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,220
Smile.

516
