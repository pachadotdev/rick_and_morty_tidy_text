00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,056
Really? You had dibs?

163
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,891
Yeah, dibs.

164
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,268
I just put them down for a second

165
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,852
while I went to the bathroom.

166
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,396
Look, I don't even want the muffins.

167
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,314
I was just looking at
them, but I got to say,

168
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:06,566
if you put muffins down,
they're not your muffins.

169
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,026
So what, I was supposed to take them

170
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,652
into the bathroom with me?

171
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:11,529
You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.

172
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,697
You just left them out here.

173
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,824
Yeah, in the produce section.

174
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:17,286
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.

175
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,996
That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,748
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

177
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,959
Then give me the muffins.

178
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:27,045
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.

179
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,005
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

180
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,548
normal rules don't apply to you?

181
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:33,343
Pseudo? Would you say
that to Eric McCormack?

182
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,471
Look, I've had a rough
morning, so I don't need...

183
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,139
You've had a rough morning?

184
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,517
I spent the last ten months...

185
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,352
Hey!

186
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,980
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

187
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,066
You're going to regret
this, BoJack Horseman.

188
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,359
[laughing] Oh, really?

189
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,736
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

190
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,906
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

191
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,992
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

192
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,035
Why'd I buy these?

193
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,792
Man, I really regret buying those muffins

194
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,128
and then eating them all on the drive home.

195
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,879
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.

196
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:10,964
Thanks for asking.

197
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,424
I specifically didn't ask,

198
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,009
and I'll thank you to respect

199
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,677
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

200
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,053
She's hilarious.

201
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:19,055
I never met a girl who was so curious

202
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,849
about American bank routing numbers.

203
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,100
Still not interested.

204
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,477
Should we get started on the book?

205
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,936
What's your hurry?

206
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,355
What do you guys think I should get Ayako

207
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,357
for our 12-hour anniversary?

208
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,318
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

209
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,694
Okay, let's get to work.

210
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,116
Let's start at the beginning.

211
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,118
What was your childhood like?

212
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,329
- Normal.
- Normal?

213
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:45,541
Yeah, it was, uh, normal...
normal childhood stuff.

214
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,709
Here's your omelet.

215
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,085
I'm sorry it's not as good

216
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,004
as the omelets your secretary makes,

217
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,173
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

218
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:56,301
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

219
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,427
I would be.

220
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,388
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

221
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,306
You're the birthday boy.

222
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,393
Normal childhood,

223
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,062
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

224
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,855
Look, if you're not ready
to talk, we can wait.

225
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,482
I am ready to talk.

226
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,067
Why wouldn't I want to
talk about my parents?

227
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,402
They're so normal. That's crazy.

228
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,237
You sound like a crazy person, not me.

229
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,654
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

230
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,448
[laughing] Why are you calling me crazy?

231
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:21,368
Okay. Was your father... [upbeat ringtone]

232
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,994
Hold on, I got to take this. Hello?

233
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,954
Hey, BoJack, I've got
Princess Carolyn for you.

234
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,582
- It's urgent.
- Great, put her on.

235
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:27,832
Just a sec. I'll see if she's available.

236
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,626
♪ When you're walking alone ♪

237
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,753
♪ Because Jellicles are ♪
♪ And... ♪

238
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,548
BoJack, are you watching MSNBSea right now?

239
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,965
Great question.

240
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,384
Well, I didn't fall down on my remote,

241
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,677
randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea

242
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,971
while simultaneously crippling myself,

243
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:45,601
thus physically forcing
me to watch MSNBSea, so no.

244
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:48,270
No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.

245
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,105
Yeah, well, Hamlet, you
might want to turn it on.

246
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,231
They're talking about you.

247
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,899
Ooh! Good things, I hope.

248
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:55,360
[sighs]

249
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,781
Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal,

250
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,325
a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.

251
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,577
Welcome to the program, Neal.

252
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,744
Thank you, Tom.

253
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,580
Hey, I met this guy.

254
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,873
All Neal wanted when he got home...

255
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:12,294
and I emphasize, from Afghanistan...

256
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,089
was his favorite brand
of breakfast muffins.

257
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,258
When he went to the
supermarket and called dibs

258
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,551
on the last box...

259
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,428
Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

260
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:25,599
BoJack Horseman, from the
'90s sitcom Horsin' Around,

261
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,643
refused to respect my dibs.

262
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:30,186
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman?

263
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,188
Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

264
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,773
Oh, not the sneezing pic...

265
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,525
Why do they always use
the sneezing picture?

266
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,694
In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.

267
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,071
Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha,"

268
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,906
we chortled in rapturous glee.

269
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,535
But when you deny the dibs
called by our men and women

270
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,829
on the frontlines, that
is a sick joke, sir.

271
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,499
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

272
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,834
and you'll forgive me
if I chortle no longer,

273
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,671
for, to me, there is
nothing the least bit funny

274
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:59,341
about stealing a meal from
Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.

275
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,883
[grunting]

276
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:04,137
Wait, wait, you stole
muffins from a Navy SEAL?

277
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,722
I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.

278
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,182
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

279
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,267
This is classic Hollywood elitism.

280
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,311
BoJack Horseman thinks
that because he was on TV,

281
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:13,021
that makes him better than everybody.

282
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,649
Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV,

283
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,400
so now I'm better than everybody!

284
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,361
That's right, Neal.

285
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,946
You didn't even have
dibs, you stupid sea cow.

286
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,199
You guys think I should call
in and set the record straight?

287
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,784
BoJack, these people feed off controversy.

288
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,953
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan...

289
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm now receiving word

290
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:33,542
that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.

291
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,917
Sorry, stopped listening.

292
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,503
You were ramping up to a "yes," right?

293
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,171
BoJack, what you did today

294
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,340
was a slap in the face of America's heroes.

295
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:43,801
Will you apologize?

296
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:46,137
Okay, enough about America's heroes.

297
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,847
Can we talk about dibs?

298
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,932
Because he didn't even really have dibs.

299
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,393
If he had legitimate dibs...

300
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,852
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

301
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,230
I hid them in the produce section!

302
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:56,773
You left them totally out in the open.

303
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,274
That's hiding?

304
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,693
[yelling] How did you
survive in Afghanistan?

305
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:00,943
Those are my muffins!

306
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:02,904
You give me back my muffins! [barks]

307
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,531
Hey, guess what, I can't give them back

308
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,741
'cause I ate them all, okay?

309
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,367
Dude.

310
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,411
Hold on, just to be
clear, since this morning,

311
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,413
you ate all the muffins?

312
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,164
Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting

313
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,542
because I have no
self-control and I hate myself.

314
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,419
Is that what you want to hear?

315
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,795
Neal, was it a small container of muffins,

316
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,463
like two to four muffins?

317
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:23,341
No, Tom, there were a
good deal more than that.

318
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,385
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

319
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,345
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

320
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,140
I ate 12 muffins, and
I didn't even want one!

321
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:33,393
There's your goddamn news story,

322
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,021
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

323
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:41,067
[pants]

324
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,860
How'd I come off?

325
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:46,615
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

326
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,411
it could have possibly gone, so hooray?

327
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,416
It's not even about the muffins.

328
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,460
Everyone is just out to get me

329
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,336
because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.

330
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,088
Well, at least you've got some privacy.

331
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,674
My boyfriend's filming a
reality show at our house.

332
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:06,676
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

333
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,637
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

334
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,887
You go on the roof?

335
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,889
Yeah, just to get some work done.

336
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,224
Is that really weird?

337
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,976
No, it's adorable.

338
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,145
When I was a kid, I used
to climb onto the roof

339
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,188
with my dad and look at the stars.

340
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:20,273
What about you?

341
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,150
Were you close with your father?

342
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,444
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

343
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,195
What is this supposed to be, a lima bean?

344
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,697
It's a heart.

345
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,408
That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.

346
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,494
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

347
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,120
You slacked off and took the easy way out.

348
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,538
In this world, you can either

349
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,123
do things the easy way or the right way.

350
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,541
You take a boat from here to New York,

351
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,293
you gonna go around the
horn like a gentleman

352
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:43,045
or cut through the Panama Canal
like some kind of democrat?

353
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,589
Um, the canal?

354
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:48,301
You go around the horn
the way God intended!

355
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,385
Uneventful.

356
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:51,596
- What?
- What?

357
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,431
I asked if you were close with your father,

358
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,475
and you sat here in
silence for five minutes

359
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,769
and then said, "Uneventful."

360
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,522
You know what, this is a
really good conversation,

361
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,106
and I definitely want to keep having it,

362
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,150
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

363
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,194
so maybe we could put a pin in this

364
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:07,654
thorough deconstruction of my past,

365
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:08,905
so I can put that other thing

366
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,657
to bed before it spirals out of con...

367
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,325
I had dibs!

368
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,911
- My dibs were on those muffins!
- Your dibs were void!

369
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,748
I spent a year in Afghanistan
making America safer,

370
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,876
and this is the thanks I get?

371
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,961
Really, you, specifically,
made America safer?

372
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,631
Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree

373
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:27,716
that the troops are heroes.

374
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,551
I don't agree to that.

375
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,261
Maybe some of the troops are
heroes but not automatically.

376
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,889
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

377
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,682
Most people are jerks already,

378
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,684
and it's not like giving a
jerk a gun and telling him

379
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,018
it's okay to kill people

380
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,730
suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.

381
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,691
What?

382
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:49,696
Did you just say you
think the troops are jerks?

383
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,031
Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?

384
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,285
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

385
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,495
No, no, no.

386
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,664
- The troops are jerks?
- Oh, God.

387
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,165
Most people are jerks already,

388
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,625
and it's not like giving a jerk a gun...

389
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,253

Great, put her on.

She's actually just

00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:24,439
I'm gonna level with you, honey.

400
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:28,192
This whole you hating the
troops thing is not great.

401
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,569
I don't hate the troops.

402
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,655
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

403
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:35,116
I just think that he's
wrong about the muffins.

404
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,034
I know, BoJack... just like always,

405
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,578
You're right, and everyone else is wrong.

406
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,662
But if you don't swallow your pride,

- That's kind of the same thing.

410
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,419
No, it's an important distinction.

411
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,170
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:07,816
Really?

420
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,943
That's the name we came up with for this?

421
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,737
Who came up with that? Was it Randy?

422
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,031
Did Randy come up with that?

423
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:16,741
Anyway, the former television actor

424
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,785
who hates our troops has not left his home

425
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,745
since his controversial remarks on Monday

426
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,371
about how he hates the troops.

427
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:24,248
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.

428
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,793
He voiced his opinion, even
though it was unpopular,

429
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:29,420
and that's the most cowardly
thing a person can do.

430
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:33,716
After we made love, he covered
himself in sheets like an Arab.

431
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,217
At this very moment,

432
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,553
Congress is voting on
a major education bill

433
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,180
that could completely restructure the...

434
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,140
Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

435
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:43,935
but we've got some big news
on the BoJack Horseman front.

436
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,396
It appears that BoJack's Lexus
is coming out of the garage.

437
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,273
This is very big news, indeed.

438
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,985
Any comment on BoJack's
controversial remarks this week?

439
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:55,196
Uh, nope. [Tires screech]

440
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:57,907
So where are we going?

441
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,117
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

442

Well, I'm out of ideas.

We can hide out at my
place while we make a plan.

00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,116
Yeah, great, just get
me away from the cameras.

459
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,619
Do we really need to be filming this?

460
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:45,204
It's for my reality show.

You never know when gold's gonna strike.

462
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:48,958
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

463
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,668
That's why you never know.

464
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,670
BoJack, be nice.

465
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:54,338
Just pretend they're not there.

00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,840
Okay. Well, I...

467
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,550
Could you speak up, please?

468
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,510
- I'd like to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

469
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,595
That's too loud.

470
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,472
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.

471
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,266
I don't care who was right
about the muffins anymore,

472
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,851
even though I was definitely right.

473
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,353
I just want my privacy
back, so I can finish writing

474
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:12,273
my tell-all memoir, so everyone
will pay attention to me again.

475
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,275
I've already reached
out to the McBeal camp.

He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

477
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,197
and present to him a box
of muffins as a symbol

478
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,700
of your great admiration
for the American military

479
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:23,785
and everything they do.

480
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,244
But I ate the muffins.

00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,370
I know. We got another box.

00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:27,830
It's in the cupboard.

483
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:29,540
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.

484
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:31,584
We've been here for ten minutes!

485
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,461
It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

486
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,797
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.

487
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,633
I just found out I got
80 bucks in the bank.

I'm helping! Hooray!

489
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,511
So where are we gonna do this?

490
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,263
Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

491
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,933
No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,644
Oh, why don't you do it
on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

493
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,271
You can't call a show
Peanutbutter and Jelly

if there's no jelly.

It's a pun.

It's not a pun if it only works one way.

497
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,694
Is this a necessary conversation

Hello, sir.

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,824
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

520
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:49,578
BoJack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

521
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:50,788
Ahem.

522
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,999
Oh, yeah, Todd?

What the hell is this?

00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,710
I tried to buy the muffins,

but my bank card got
declined for some reason.

526

But don't worry, I still saved the day

527
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,384
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

528
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,511
I'm sorry?

529
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,847
Yeah, they're just giving
them away behind In-N-Out.

530
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,141
Why does anybody pay for anything?

531
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,642
Ow.

532
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,103
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration,

533
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:19,108
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

534
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,569
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

535
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:25,198
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans

536
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:27,867
in the trash, sadly, far too often.

537
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,827
I'm listening.

538
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,662
We send our muffins overseas,

539
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,123
and they come back as stale hamburger buns,

540
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:37,085
but that doesn't mean we
should love them any less,

541
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,669
because in their own way,

542
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:42,673
aren't stale hamburger buns just as good?

543
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:44,967
Mmm.

544
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,343
American made.

545
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:50,347
So what you're saying is,

546
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,767
you think I'm a hero.

547
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,060
Well, I don't know if I...

548
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,023
Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

549
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,524
You're a hero.

550
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:04,112
The troops are all
heroes, every single one.

551
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,947
Great.

552
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,616
And I don't believe saying
that cheapens the word

553
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,993
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

554
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,205
by turning real people
into political pawns.

555
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,083
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

556
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,627
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

557
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,046
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

558
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,090
by a nation that claims to value peace

559
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:26,968
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

560
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,138
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

561
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,848
Yeah, me neither. I think
we're in agreement here.

562
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:35,977
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

563
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,021
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

564
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:40,606
a genre which thrives on

565
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,608
chopping the complexities of our era

566
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:46,195
into easily digestible
chunks of empty catchphrases.

567
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,239
Okay.

568
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,074
And finally, I don't...

Okay, full truth, here we go.

You want to know about my parents?

They drank a lot.

617
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,936
My father was a failed novelist.

618

My mother was the heiress to
the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

and my dad resented her for it.

while listening to Cole Porter records.

622

He made me build my own tree house,

623
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,697
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

I used screws, which he
called fancy Jew nails.
