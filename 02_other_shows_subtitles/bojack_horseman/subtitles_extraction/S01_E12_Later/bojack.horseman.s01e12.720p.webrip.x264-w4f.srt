00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,207
surely you can make them
care about emaciated orphans

158
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,709
with missing limbs.

159
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,211
We need to wake people up.

160
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,005
Well, I am a morning person.

161
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,174
I hope you mean mourning with a "u,"

162
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,510
because, Diane, this is deadly serious.

163
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,179
Oh, yes, of course.

164
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,143
You want to spend three months in Sudan?

165
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,561
Not just there. We're also
going to Haiti and Thailand

166
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,688
and Uganda and Chechnya.

167
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,398
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

168
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,275
I want to do something important.

169
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,361
I want to help people and do good work

170
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,573
and sleep on the ground
and poop in a bucket.

171
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,951
Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.

172
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,912
Maybe I do. Maybe I
want to poop in a bucket.

173
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,456
If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.

174
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,583
You don't have to go all
the way the Chechnylavakia.

175
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,960
Am I saying that right?

176
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,837
It's not just the pooping in a bucket.

177
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,839
I think it might be good
for me to get out of L.A.

178
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,090
for a little bit.

179
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,843
Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,

180
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,761
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for

181
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,805
in these awful made-up places.

182
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,724
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.

183
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,144
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.

184
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,355
It's to just keep yourself
busy with unimportant nonsense,

185
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,482
and eventually, you'll be dead.

186
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,153
Well, I guess I can keep my options open.

187
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,237
Great.

188
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,489
[whistles gleefully]

189
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,201
Hey, can I ask you something?

190
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,954
Did Vincent seem extra
weird to you last night?

191
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,748
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

192
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,292
We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.

193
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,294
He's works a full time job
at the business factory,

194
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,921
so when he gets home,

195
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,132
he just wants to unwind
by watching R-rated movies.

196
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,425
Ahh, I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,

197
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,844
- but...
- [snores]

198
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,471
Enough about me. BoJack, you are on fire.

199
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,515
Oh, are we talking about me again?

200
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,018
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy

201
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,477
in the new James Bond.

202
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,813
- Ehh.
- I agree. Total garbage.

203
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,524
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen Brothers.

204
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,069
A western about a one-horse
town and you're the horse.

205
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,571
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

206
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
I think now's the time to
finally make "Secretariat."

207
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,451
Really? Now? Aren't you a
little, um, very too old?

208
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,495
You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.

209
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,873
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,

210
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,209
then all of this has been for nothing.

211
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,919
Oh, fish. Of course!

212
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,837
Why would you ever make things easy for me

213
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,548
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?

214
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,675
Laura, clear out the rest of my day.

215
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,552
I have to push a boulder up a hill,

216
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,846
and then have it roll
over me time and time again

217
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,848
with no regard for my well-being.

218
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,933
Attagirl.

219
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,229
All right, Todd. PB
Livin' needs a new project.

220
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,607
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks
has been an enormous success,

221
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,984
but I got into this game to make movies,

222
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,611
so let's make a movie.

223
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,446
Well, I got a stack of great scripts here.

224
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,073
Any one of them would
make a wonderful movie.

225
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,699
Fantastic.

226
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,828
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

227
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,330
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

228
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,082
Okay. I was heading down Wilshire,

229
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,210
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

230
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,212
"You know what this world needs?"

231
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,880
Edge of my seat over here.

232
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,592
A store where people
can buy Halloween stuff.

233
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,470
Halloween store. Feel
like that's been done.

234
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,388
Yeah, in October,

235
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,934
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

236
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,228
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

237
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,605
A Halloween store that's open year-round.

238
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,108
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

239
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,153
That's the kind of idea
that wins Golden Globes.

240
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,158
I actually think the time
is right for "Secretariat,"

241
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,451
so what do you want to
play, like, Secretariat's dad

242
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,204
or his grandfather, maybe
like an elderly witch doctor

243
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,206
who puts a curse on him or something?

244
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,458
Lenny, look, I know I'm a
little long in the tooth,

245
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,252
but I think that you more than anyone

246
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,629
would know not to count out an old pro.

247
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,464
Don't play the ageism card with me, kid.

248
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,883
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

249
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,137
But Secretariat was dead at
27, so who we kidding here?

250
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,097
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

251
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,598
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

252
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,100
You got yourself a "go" picture, kid.

253
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,102
And by you, I mean me. And by "go" picture,

254
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,355
I mean I'll make some phone
calls, we'll see what I can do.

255
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,649
And by kid, I mean middle-aged adult.

256
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,695
[whispers] Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

257
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,031
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

258
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,326
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

259
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,371
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

260
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,373
What's going on? Why are
you talking like that?

261
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,333
Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea

262
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,043
for a Halloween costume.

263
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,170
Why don't you and I dash
over to the store right quick

264
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,547
and spend some hard-earned American money?

265
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,508
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear?

266
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,511
It's January, and the
Halloween store won't open

267
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,139
for another nine months.

268
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,599
But I want satisfaction now.

269
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,977
Has this ever happened to you?

270
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,021
Not to anyone ever at any time.

271
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,774
Ahem. We give you Halloween in January,

272
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,903
a truly immersive Halloween experience

273
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,030
for the rest of us.

274
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,741
Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

275
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,993
Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.

276
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,329
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

277
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:48,083
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

278
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,668
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

279
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,756
Also, there's less Halloween
stores. Coincidence?

280
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,385
Wow, I'm convinced. This
store could save lives.

281
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,262
Unbelievable. When your powers combine...

282
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,848
you are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

283
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,641
- Thank you.
- Go on.

284
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,103
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

285
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,896
The two of you are playing with fire.

286
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,190
A fire called Having a Good Idea.

287
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,943
Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

288
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,862
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

289
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,239
Or Fire Island.

290
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,990
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

291
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,951
Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

292
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,953
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

293
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,537
[groans]

294
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,796
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

295
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,089
I don't know.

296
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,091
What's under that coat, Vincent?

297
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,802
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

298
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,678
I have to call the guy at the office

299
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,722
and take the car to the place.

300
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,475
It's always guys in places with you.

301
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,768
You know, I thought I
wanted to date a real adult,

302
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,853
but I'm actually young at heart.

303
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,189
I need to feel the grass between my toes.

304
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,733
I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.

305
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,944
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

306
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,655
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

307
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,741
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

308
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,828
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

309
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,247
What's mahumanunny?

310
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,249
Well, clearly we had a
different understanding

311
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,251
of what this was.

312
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,212
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

313
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,924
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

314
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,592
Okay.

315
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,178
Okay.

316
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,264
Could I have another soda?

317
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,270
BoJack, you know Kelsey
Jannings, our director.

318
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,523
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

319
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,065
Yeah.

320
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,818
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.

321
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.

322
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,698
Well, you know, here was
a guy who had everything...

323
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,783
Yeah, I know the story. I'm the director.

324
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,702
Kelsey, be nice.

325
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,745
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

326
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,582
read for this today, and
we are all so goddamn sick

327
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
of seeing auditions, so
whenever you're ready.

328
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,169
Just jump right in.

329
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,296
Great. Let's get to it.

330
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,590
[stilted] Hey, ain't you that horse

331
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,259
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

332
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,679
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

333
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,515
Can I ask you a question?

334
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,517
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

335
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,768
- what are you running from?
- You want to know the truth?

336
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,396
Nothing.

337
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,647
Everyone's running from something, sugar.

338
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,735
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.

339
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,820
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,

340
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,239
they want my picture.

341
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,033
They think they recognize something in me,

342
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,119
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.

343
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,705
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,

344
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,750
but I... I know there's nothing there.

345
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,880
As fast as I run, I
can't get way from that.

346
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,465
- Oh.
- Wow.

347
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,885
BoJack, I think I speak
for everyone when I say...

348
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,931
Oh, my God, Andrew Garfield said yes.

349
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,767
- We have our Secretariat.
- We got Andrew Garfield?

350
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,227
Oh, my God, it's the best day of my life.

351
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
[Lenny] You don't say no to Spider-Man.

352
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,105
[Kelsey] This movie is gonna be amazing.

353
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,314
Andrew...

354
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,443
Garfield!

355
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,404
Now, the pills will give you nightmares...

356
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,696
I mean, just horrifying...

357
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,698
but the malaria will give you death,

358
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,076
so you're going to want
to take the pills, Diane.

359
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,702
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on.

360
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,040
A mosquito got into my
tent. What do you want?

361
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,293
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Hello?

362
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,629
Diane, it's Princess
Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

363
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,255
Yeah, I know who you are.

364
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date BoJack.

365
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,135
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

366
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,637
Listen, the Turteltaub Company

367
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,639
is making a movie about Secretariat.

368
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,515
And since you're such an expert,

369
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,685
they want to bring you on
board as a character consultant.

370
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,437
What does that mean?

371
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,063
Oh, it's the cushiest job in the world.

372
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,982
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.

373
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,943
And then once a week, you say,
"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

374
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,070
I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.

375
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,323
And did you know there
are orphans in Sudan...

376
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,325
You take this job, you can
buy all the orphans you want.

377
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,160
No, I don't want to buy them.

378
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,162
Look, if you really want to help people,

379
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,289
it doesn't hurt to have a
little money in your pocket.

380
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,500
Take the job now, help the orphans later.

381
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,835
- There's always later.
- Hmm.

382
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,211
Okay, talk it over with your husband.

383
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,005
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.

384
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,258
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

385
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,262
- How's the pie here?
- Not good.

386
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,888
Well, I'll take all you got.

387
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,683
Screw it. Throw it in
a bowl with some bourbon

388
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,934
- and bring me a
ladle. - Mm-hmm.

389
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,771
BoJack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,

390
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,651
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

391
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,695
It's an exciting new business venture

392
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,071
that's equal parts new and exciting.

393
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,782
Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

394
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,284
- What now?
- Oh, right.

395
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,161
The Halloween store.

396
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,079
We took the floor out

397
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,708
because Mr. Peanutbutter kept
scratching up the hardwood,

398
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,585
and then... Did we ever
get the new floor installed?

399
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,003
Uh...

400
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,755
Halloween? In January?

401
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,341
What a great ide... Aah!

402
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,800
[thud]

403
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,428
Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

404
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,597
- What?
- Smoodies.

405
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,307
You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

406
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,892
No. Smoodies.

407
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,645
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

408
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,481
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

409
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,775
- Like a smoothie.
- So it is a smoothie.

410
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,612
No, it's a smoodie...
A mood that you drink.

411
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,324
- How do you drink a mood?
- Like a smoothie.

412
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,578
But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

413
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,580
We haven't worked out all the kinks yet,

414
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,582
but the important thing
is we've gone public,

415
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,751
and we want you to get
in on the ground floor.

416
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,669
See, that's the problem
with all your ideas...

417
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,755
they don't have ground floors.

418
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,925
Finally, a Halloween store

Anyway, our launch party's tonight,

422
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,684
- and we'd love it if you came.
- We spared no expense...

423
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,936
that's how confident we are in our product.

424
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,521
- Your product... Smoodies.
- Yes.

425
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,315
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies?

426
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,443
Because we only make...
Which one do we make?

427

I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

Ahh, I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.

- Smoodie cozy?

Todd, it is all happening.

00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,964
Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

435
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,425
All right. Now we just
got to make sure we focus

436
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,385
and actually follow through on this.

437

I'd feel awful if this
great idea fell apart

438
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,307
because we got distracted
by something else,

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,850
as we are often wont to do.

440

Wait, did you say you
feel awful or falafel?

441

I said, "Feel awful,"

but tell me more about this falafel idea.

- I've got half a mind to...
- No, let me talk.

I had a attitude problem,

but then I took a timeout,

456
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
and I thought about what I did.

I wanted to be a big man.

But sometimes the biggest thing
a man can do is tell the truth.

467
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,135
- Hello?
- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

468
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,888
I got some news about "Secretariat."

469
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,264
- What's up?
- Garfield's out.

470
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,058
He got into some sort of accident.

471
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,268
An All Hallows' Eve store in January?

472
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,564
How fiendishly droll. Aah!

473
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,981
[thud]

474
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,650
Oh, bother.

475
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,777
The clumsy bastard broke
every bone in his body,

476
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,654
and now we got to find a new lead.

477
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,823
Studio wants to go young,
but I was thinking we'd get

478
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,784
someone a little more BoJack Horseman.

479
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,703
What? Are you serious?

480
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,747
You're the only one with
enough grit to play the part,

481
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,207
and we can age you down in
post, but I'm gonna tell you now,

482
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,501
not gonna put up with
any woe-is-me bullshit

483
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,127
or diva histrionics.

484
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,796
I get enough of that from my ex-wife

485
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,173
along with newspaper
clippings about gluten.

486
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,593
God, we get it, Marla. Gluten.

487
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,011
But if you want to make a movie,
and you're ready to work...

488
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,389
I am. I will. I can. I do.

489
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,974
Great. You got one month to get in shape.

490
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,268
You need to lose 50 pounds
and then gain back 20.

491
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,895
- And, BoJack...
- Yeah?

492
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,730
Don't ever call this number.

493
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,356
If I want to talk, I'll call you.

494
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,649
[cell phone beeps]

495
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,905
- Hey.
- Hey.

496
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,573
Not big on parties, huh?

497
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,825
Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

498
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,327
I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

499
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,456
- That's amazing.
- It's everything I ever wanted.

500
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,751
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.
- What do I do now?

501
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,336
Well, that's the problem with life, right?

502
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,839
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

503
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

504
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,177
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

505
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,221
I don't know if this makes
you more or less excited,

506
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,933
but I actually decided to take
a job on the Secretariat movie

507
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,977
as a character consultant.

508
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,896
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

509
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,898
Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

510
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,691
I don't think that's gonna happen.

511
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,360
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

512
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,822
You literally wrote
the book on Secretariat.

513
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,533
Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to L.A...

514
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,495
I thought I was gonna be
doing really important work.

515
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,831
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

516
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,042
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

517
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,294
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

518
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,254
Yeah, I guess there's always later.

519
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,381
Do you remember the last time I saw you?

520
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,176
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down?

521
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,054
Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

522
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,598
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

523
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,602
Well, do you think I'm a
good person... deep down?

524
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,229
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

525
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,733
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

526
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,862
- Well, that's depressing.
- [laughs]

527
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,697
For what it's worth,

528
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,615
I think your writing
does make a difference.

529
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,158
Thanks.
