160
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,702
Oh, they did, and then I
just mixed it with bourbon.

161
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,245
And it hit me.

162
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,164
Why was I so upset about
Diane getting engaged?

163
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:57,542
You're the one who's
always been there for me,

164
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,043
so I drank a lot more bourbon

165
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,086
and drove over to tell you how I feel.

166
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,754
Oh, I see what this is.

167
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,174
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

168
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,301
Clearly we're in love with each other.

169
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,303
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.

170
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
And you're not even
really in love with her.

171
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,764
You just think you are because you pay her

172
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,266
to listen to you talk about yourself.

173
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,767
Diane getting engaged was the best thing

174
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,019
that ever happened to me.

175
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,688
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

176
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:23,275
Ha! You say that every
time something bad happens.

177
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,985
Not getting nominated for
a People's Choice Award

178
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,737
is the best thing that ever happened to me.

179
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,239
It made me realize...

180
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,907
Getting caught with that pound of cocaine

181
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,742
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

182
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,244
That hooker getting pregnant

183
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,537
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,414
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best...

185
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,874
Every time something bad happens,

186
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,918
you come running to me for comfort.

187
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,794
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.

188
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,005
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.

189
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,757
- It just doesn't work.
- [knock on door]

190
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,634
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

191
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,094
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

192
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,638
But remember, I'm coming for you,

193
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,266
and I'm gonna make you love me.

194
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,184
Please don't. Hey.

195
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,477
Bad news, P.C.

196
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,771
Braff used your merger as
an opportunity to jump ship.

197
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:01,939
Aw, fish.

198
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,358
Now his new agent's
asking for twice the money.

199
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
As I once said to a young Lionel Barrymore,

200
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,695
"Eh, shut up."

201
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,865
Without a director, Eva
Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.

202
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,200
Yep. You got to get someone big.

203
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,786
- What about those brothers...
- Hello? Hello?

204
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,329
Lady, you work too hard.

205
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,373
That was an important phone call.

206
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,500
Important phone call beep boop blorp.

207
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,085
Don't you robot-voice me.

208
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,588
Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

209
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,965
Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

210
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,342
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

211
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,885
to remember me by.

212
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,887
Since we can't be together every second,

213
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,182
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard BoJack.

214
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,725
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip,

215
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,018
so every time you walk by it,

216
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,395
it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire,

217
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
your favorite movie.

218
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,981
You complete me.

219
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,274
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

220
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,900
You had me at "hello."

221
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,069
I don't have time for you or cardboard you.

222
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,404
I need to find a new director.

223
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,491
Or you could find my nude erector...

224
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,617
She's gone.

225
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,202
[jazzy music]

226
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,412
[elevator bell dings]

227
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,206
Blech. Word to the wise, Laura...

228
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,001
Do not pitch a Nazi
romance to Steven Spielberg.

229
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,503
Just thought you should know

230
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,878
there's been some reorganization

231
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,880
- vis-a-vis resource management.
- What are you saying?

232
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,716
You and Vanessa Gekko are sharing an office

233
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,468
until they can find her a permanent one.

234
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,386
- The hell we are.
- Also...

235
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,930
Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

236
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,056
What?

237
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,017
You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,

238
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,686
so I'm firing you.

239
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,312
Now we can be in love.

240
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:26,231
- Hope you like money, BoJack.
- This is so great.

241
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,067
Now I can date you and have a better agent.

242
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,653
- Everybody wins.
- Oh.

243
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm a sporting agent.

244
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,366
Are you still searching for happiness?

245
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,826
Make your own happiness.

246
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,330
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.

247
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,998
Cut. That was great.

248
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,417
Was it? You know, I'm
trying to do good work here,

249
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,379
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting

250
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,880
to have all these robots

251
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,049
staring at me with their blinking red eyes.

252
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,885
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.

253
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,762
Oh, well, you want to make a good one?

254
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,805
Then get them the hell out of here!

255
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,393
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,

256
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,395
and I'm determined to get the jargon

257
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,440
of this German bourbon blurbin'.

258
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,900
Is it just me, or does this fake booze

259
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,777
taste a lot like real booze?

260
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,613
You want BoJack, you can have him.

261
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,699
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,

262
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,325
studios that won't hire him,

263
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,493
former assistants with restraining orders.

264
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,911
This is great.

265
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:22,371
You know, it gets kind of boring

266
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,415
when all your clients are in such demand,

267
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,250
they practically find their own jobs.

268
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,794
Well, then BoJack should
be a lot of fun for you.

269
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,171
- No one wants to hire him.
- [knock on door]

270
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,800
Hello. We're looking for
BoJack Horseman's agent.

271
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,468
We'd like to discuss

272
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,012
a very lucrative business opportunity.

273
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,265
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm BoJack's agent.

274
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:44,393
The opportunity is we're blackmailing you.

275
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,144
Ha. All yours.

276
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,730
Needless to say,

277
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,274
it would be a shame if
these pictures got out.

278
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,651
Fortunately, that can easily be avoided

279
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:58,657
by simply paying me and
my partner here $150.

280
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,950
Each.

281
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,159
Let me just get my checkbook.

282
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
Huh?

283
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,788
- Whoa.
- [chuckles]

284
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,457
Oh, except California law
prohibits taking photos

285
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,375
on private property without a permit,

286
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,460
but you had a permit, right?

287
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,211
- Uh...
- What's that?

288
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,504
Oh, also, extortion can be prosecuted

289
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,672
as a class E felony.

290
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,466
That's four years in prison, easy,

291
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,426
and when you throw in the
murder of Tupac Shakur...

292
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,552
- We didn't do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,053
You can't pin that on us.

294
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,597
Well, someone's got to take the fall.

295
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,890
- [both gulp]
- Sorry to bother you.

296
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,017
Forget we were ever here.

297
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,856
That was fun.

298
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,858
Hey, Laura, send those guys
a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

299
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,276
You got it, boss.

300
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,902
Who said you could use my assistant?

301
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,781
- I did.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

302
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,449
Did you know the human
head weighs 8 pounds?

303
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,826
Fascinating.

304
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,453
So sorry we have to double up on everything

305
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,456
while we work out who goes
where and who gets fired,

306
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,835
but in the meantime, help
yourself to an intern,

307
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,712
one of the rising stars at our company...

308
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,591
- Charlie Witherspoon.
- Hello. I... Oh.

309
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,886
Sorry, my... My hands are really sticky.

310
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,013
[groans]

311
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,766
Oh, God, am I blowing this?

312
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,476
[glass shatters]

313
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,228
Charlie was the editor
of The Harvard Lampoon.

314
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,772
He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant

315
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,981
while I use Laura.

316
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,107
- Ugh.
- Good thinking, boss.

317
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,651
[phone rings]

318
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,236
Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,864
What do I do? What do I do?

320
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,574
I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.

321
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,035
Princess Carolyn, your
client is out of control.

322
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,120
BoJack is not my client anymore.

323
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,747
Not BoJack. Todd.

324
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,500
I think someone mixed
alcohol into his prop drink.

325
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,043
Oh, you pretenders.

326
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,961
Bourbon is the name of a county.

327
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,798
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.

328
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,842
That would be like
making Rice-A-Roni

329
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,720
- anywhere but San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no, no.

330
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,806
- Ugh. I'll be right there.
- Ow.

331
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,516
You got to get your shit together.

332
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,352
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd... Hold on.

333
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:54,231
4:30 P.M. Meeting with Eva Braun team.

334
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,693
Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn...

335
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,695
- What's your last name?
- Chavez.

336
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,572
- Your last name is Chavez?
- Yeah. Why?

337
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,073
I don't know, I just never thought of you

338
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,742
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

339
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,535
I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

340
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,119
I know, but I got a movie to put together.

341
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,246
Best of luck.

342
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,249
Ready for the tagline? Here's the tagline.

343
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,333
What the heck is going on?

344
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,294
"The woman who loved the
man who hated everyone."

345
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,422
- That writes itself.
- You got to be kidding me.

346
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,050
Hey, where were you? We looked everywhere.

347
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,261
You're having the Eva
Braun meeting without me?

348
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,054
I'm so sorry,

349
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,181
but I didn't know what the
protocol was around here,

350
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,141
and these guys were
just champing at the bit.

351
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,185
- We're just wrapping up.
- But Cate is my client.

352
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,145
Okay, why don't I come
find you when it's over,

353
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,773
and I'll bring you up to speed?

354
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

355
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,735
Yeah. I brought him on board.

356
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,904
You know he's always wanted
to direct a romantic comedy?

357
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,155
Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

358
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,574
[sing-song] Bye.

359

[dramatic music]

360
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:51,830
We live in a cynical
world, a cynical world.

361
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,082
He's right, you know.

362
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:57,335
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

363
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,004
I just missed an important meeting

364
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,465
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,

365
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,592
because you switched out the prop bourbon

366
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,386
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

367
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,639
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- No way.

368
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,225
Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.

369
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,769
Probably more than one
bottle and some entrees.

370
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,562
And I'll probably get an appetizer.

371
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,439
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

372
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,942
- I have to work.
- You don't have to work.

373
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,487
- You choose to work.
- Hmm.

374
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,781
Why not choose to be happy for once?

375
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,783
Mm.

376
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,368
[soft piano music]

377
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,870
When you're writing a memoir,

378
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,706
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.

379
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,584
I regret not being a better friend to you

380
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,294
and lover.

381
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,587
Thank you.

382
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,006
Lover's kind of a weird word,

383
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:43,674
but thanks.

384
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,759
You want to get out of
this stuffy old restaurant,

385
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,219
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean

386
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,598
- and put our feet in the water?
- That sounds great.

387
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,600
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

388
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,020
Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.

389
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,521
You scamper right back, pussycat.

390
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,064
You look at your reflection too long,

391
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,649
you might fall in love. She's gone.

What do you want, Gekko?

394
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
Well, I was hoping to
talk to you face-to-face,

395
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,490
but I guess you had to leave work early.

396
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:10,325
I left at 8:30. What is it?

397
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,745
Well, Cate and I had a
really good talk today.

398
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,622
We have so much in common,

399
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,958
and especially since I'm
doing so much for Eva Braun,

400
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,418
it almost seemed weird
that I wasn't repping her.

401
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,754
No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

402
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,131
She and I are both
high-powered working mothers,

403
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,551
so I understand her priorities,

404
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,594
so she's switching to Gekko.

405
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,263
Wow, being a mom helped my career?

406
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,432
I really can have it all.

407
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,935
This isn't fair. I know
everything about Cate.

408
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,436
Her favorite color is red.

409
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,230
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.

410

Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

411

I know all I need to know,

412
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,235
which is that she's
beautiful, she's British,

413
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,653
and she's gonna make me a lot of money.

She's Australian, you moron.

- Hello.
- I just want you to know I'm fine.

481
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,786
Uh-oh. People only say they're
fine when they're not fine.

482
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,621
Did I hurt your feelings last night?

483
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,540
I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

484
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,084
Well, I'm glad you called.

485
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,418
I think that you had
the right idea yesterday.

486
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,711
I should be getting back to work.

487
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,421
Can you get me another job?

488
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,257
Yeah, well, I'm not your
agent anymore, so, no.

489
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,884
Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then.

Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

495
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,896
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.

496
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,607
Plus, he hates me, so I could
really use some good news

at the end of the day.

Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb?

You must be really...

My tie got stuck in

- Good luck.
- Oh, yeah, about that.

Gwyneth came in this morning,

511
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,093
and I wanted to show her
that she was a top priority,

512
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,011
so I shredded BoJack's contract

513
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,387
right in front of her. Heh heh

514

Todd: What? I'm busy.

523
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,703
BoJack: Never mind.
Think I've figured it out.

524
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,290

If you want to get him a movie

by the end of the day, great, do that.

Otherwise, we are washing our hands of him.

How'd you like to work
with the BoJack Horseman?

542
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,415
What's that? You hate his guts?

What's that? He's a talentless boob?

What's that? You'll never
work with BoJack again?

What's that?

You want him to die in an
ass factory warehouse fire,

a pile of burning asses?

mind, give me a call.

all this trouble for him.

so he could propose to his girlfriend?

608
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,929
That would make a great movie,

609
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,306
but who would play the lead?

610
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,517
Preferably someone kind of washed up.
