Horseman. I'm an old friend.

-I can't believe you came to my concert.
-It was incredible.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,085
When you sang that one ballad
and shot fireworks out of your boobs,

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,671
that was such a moving tribute
to gays in the military.

14

We are going out.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,466
Before you go, I need you
to sign these posters.

16

It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay. BoJack, can you
hang out for a minute?

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,932
-Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
-Also, we have those radio records,

19

-You mean Calvin Klein.
-Kevin Kline, BoJack.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,732
He's the only man who truly
understands my fragrance.

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,485
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,367
-Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
-No, but, like, really famous.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,786
-Uh...
-How can I explain it to someone like you?

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,957
I feel like all my friends only like me
because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,668
-Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
-Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,587
The lawyer who helped me change
my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.

Oof!

31
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,259
It is so great to see a real friend
who knew me before I got huge

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,177
and isn't just trying
to get something out of me.

33
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,095
Right.

34

the only one I have left.

35

I know I'm smiling right now,
but the light inside me is dying.

Uh, what?

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,609
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing
about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,485
What is going on with you?

40
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

41
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,117
-I don't know if you've seen it or--
-Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah, no, of course, no,
but it's been a lot of fun.

43
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,415
The ratings aren't great,
but we have this upcoming episode,

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,960
and we're looking
for a really big guest star.

45
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,088
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

46
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:15,552
Well, I just thought it would
be really fun for... the both of us.

47
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
You know, like the old days.

48
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,267
I have the script with me
if you want to take a look at it.

49
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,228
Um, okay. Why don't you put it
on that pile over there?

50
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,564
And I'll get to it
when I have some free time.

51
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,066
-Over here?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,818
I'd love to keep hanging out,
but these doctors need their posters,

53
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,403
and I'm already pretty exhausted.

54
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,529
You should probably go.

55
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,324
-Oh, okay.
-It's all very exhausting.

56
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,617
Thanks again for coming.

57

-What can you tell us, Carla?
-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

125
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
it will expand, smothering the town

126
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,971
and tenderly broiling the sea life
who reside there.

127
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,514
Is there any way to prevent

this delicious-sounding
environmental catastrophe?

129
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,186
The only hope for rescue would be

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
if someone had an enormous quantity
of spaghetti strainers

131
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
just sitting around the house,

132
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
but that person would also need
access to a fleet of drivers

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,904
to transport said spaghetti strainers,

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,239
and in order to strain
the spaghetti fast enough,

135
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,076
the drivers would also need to be
incredibly strong swimmers,

136
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,954
like, just as an example,
hot, sexy killer whales.

00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,735
And, for half an hour every week,
I had a home,

228
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,862
and it helped me survive.

229
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:41,200
BoJack, there are millions of people
who are better off for having known you.

Why did you never tell me that?

231

people need shows like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

244

I... need a show like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

245
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,665
Okay, but this isn't
like last time, is it?

Where you say you want to do it,

247
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,502
but then, I find out
you don't actually want to do it,

248
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

249
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,923
And, at the airport, on the way home,
I get one of those big pretzels,

250
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
but then, I drop the pretzel
on the ground,

251
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,551
and it gets eaten by a ant?

It's funny. You help out

and, suddenly, everybody loves you,
unless you're Sean Penn.

262
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,786
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.

263
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,081
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,
and you can buy most kinds of press.

264
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
I hope some of that press
makes its way to this reader

265
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
because she is not a fan
of Cabracadabra.

266
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,424
-She hates it.
-I don't hate Cabracadabra.

267
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,842
I just think it objectifies women

268
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,262
and contributes to a cheap and damaging
culture of sexist commodification

269
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,015
that undercuts the exact reason
it was started in the first place.

270
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,725
But, you know, everything does that.

271
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>Cosmo </i>does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.

272
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,191
Yes, but this objectification of women
ended up saving lots of lives,

273
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,696
many of whom were also women,
so, therefore, not sexist?

274
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,656
I can't argue with that.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to anymore,

276
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,452

Oh!

You know, it's really too bad
you shut down the agency,

279
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
because, if you could've held out
for just a couple more months,

280
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,084
right now,
Vim would be rolling in money.

how to treat a cat.

that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?

301
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,470
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/
newsletter/community hub,

302
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,183
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

303
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,352
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.

304
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,105
Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info?

305
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,317
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.

306
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,653
-Except enjoying your time off, right?
-Right.

307
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,947
Wow, another amazing offer!

308
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,074
It's like everywhere I look,
money, money, money!

309
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,660
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

311
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,958
-I like your friends.
-Yeah.

312
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
And I like this.

[both]
Mwah!

314
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
-This is working.
-I like it, too.

315
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,423
That was smart of you
to think of Diane for GirlCrush.

316
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,799
You're always making great connections.

317
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,384
That's probably why you were
such a good manager.

318
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,679
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

319
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad that it's over,

320
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,516
because I don't want
to share you with anybody.

321
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh, my God!
Maybe that was the problem!

322
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,896
-Maybe what was the problem?
-All this time, I thought I was an agent,

323
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,983
but what if what I was really
supposed to be was a manager?

324
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,861
-What's the difference?
-It's a completely different line of work.

325
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,779
An agent helps a client find jobs,

326
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,574
but a manager helps manage
a client's career.

327
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,118
-It sounds exactly the same.
-I think I'm having an epiphany.

328
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,370
It's like I've been wearing
the wrong bra size this whole time.

329
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,914
Okay, if this is the thing
that'll make you happy,

330
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,666
then I totally support you,

331
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,879
but it kind of sounds like you're just
going back to the same sort of job

332
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,630
that made you miserable
for the last 20 years.

333
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,924
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?
This is a new beginning.

334
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,011
-I'm gonna be a manager!
-Oh...

335
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,432
-Wow.
-Takes you back, doesn't it?

336
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,559
Listen, before everyone
gets here tomorrow,

337
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
I have a couple notes on the script.

338
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,438
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"
or not enough?

339
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,106
No. On page 18,

340
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,901
Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia
to put on the roller skates,

341
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
and she runs out of the room crying,

342
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,904
and then, the Horse says,
"That went well."

343
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,325
-Anything about that feel weird to you?
-No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.

344
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,495
It didn't go well. So, when the Horse
says, "That went well," it's funny.

345
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,747
-Dramatic irony.
-No, I get the irony.

346
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,583
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.

347
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,544
-You're giving me the cut to commercial.
-And that's a problem for you?

348
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,673
This is <i>Ethan Around. </i>It's your show,
and we need to tell the audience that.

349
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,843
-You can't give all the best jokes to me.
-I don't know, BoJack.

350
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,346
You really think I'm ready
for a "That went well"?

351
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
-You tell me. Let's hear it.
-That went well!

352
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,059
You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny. Trust the line.

353
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,353
-That went well.
-Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.

354
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,856
-Oh, like a-- That went well.
-Yes, that was great!

355
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
And that was a great look,
with the eyebrow.

356
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,485
-What if we both did that?
-Yeah, yeah.

357
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,611
I'm looking at you like,

358

"This parenting thing is gonna
be harder than I thought,"

359
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,242
and you're looking at me like,
"Now you see what I had to go through."

360
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,369
-Exactly. Let's try it.
-Well, that went well.

361
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,286
[both]
Hmm...

362
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,039
-Oh, my God. Chills.
-Yeah, you feel that?

363
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,208
-Yeah.
-Now that's how you cut to commercial.

This place has really gone downhill
since they got that new chef.

367
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,262
As I was saying, I don't think the site
needs to be just one thing.

368
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,848
I think it can be a big umbrella,
but, like, also not an umbrella.

That's GirlCroosh.

370

Sorry, did you say "croosh"?

371
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,563
Oh, you do not need
to apologize here, Diane.

372
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,983
"Sorry" is a crutch
and "crutch" is an ableist term.

373
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm sorry if that shocks you,
but I will not apologize for it.

So, can I ask what
the business model is here?

375
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,283
Diane, I'm rich.
I'm not doing this to make money.

376
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,994
I'm doing this to make connections
with real women

Well, you know what's great about that is,

what you do is so croosh.

-One thing though. Is anything off limits?

about your husband, could you do it?

is basically Hooters on wheels?

-He's actually selling that company.
-Well, he's still a public figure.

392
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,494
What if Mr. Peanutbutter
does something problematic

393

and you have a real hot take?

394
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,749
If I have a problem with my husband,
I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.

395
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,585
Okay, so what if you did that
and he didn't listen,

396
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,046
and you knew that,
as much as you love him

397
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,717
and as much as he loves you,
he's never gonna get it?

398
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,845
And meanwhile, you also knew
that all your readers looked up to you

399
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,431
and wanted to read your opinion?

that says, "Hey, look at my hat."

-[both laugh]
-What about you?

449
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,803
I've always wanted to go
to a super nice restaurant

450
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,679
and order everything on the menu.

451
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,599
Oh, yeah! That's, like,
first day millionaire stuff.

452
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,185
We should go sometime, together.

453
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,313
-Todd, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

454
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,482
What's your deal?

455
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,068
I feel like you like me,
but you don't like me,

456
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,820
but you like me,
and I don't know what that is.

457
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,987
Are you gay?

458
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,533
-Whoa. Why would you even--?
-You can tell me if you're gay. It's fine.

459
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,828
This isn't the 1600s,
or some places in the present.

460
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,456
I'm not gay.
I mean, I don't think I am,

461
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,501
but... I don't think I'm straight, either.

462
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,087
I don't know what I am.

463
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,297
I think I might be nothing.

464
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,050
-Oh. Well, that's okay.
-Yeah?

465
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,760
Yeah, of course.

466

[Southern accent]
Thank you so much.

467
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,686
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped
the waitress eight million dollars!

468
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, guess I'm broke again.

Pizza?

472
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,247
Katrina, you're not pizza.

473
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,040
Ugh. This fight again?

474
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,586
Listen, butt-sniffer, I work for a guy
and we're looking for a guy.

475
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
You're supposed to be this big hero now,

476
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,715
so someone brought your name up
in a meeting,

477
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,466
and, now, I have an opportunity for you.

478
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,220
Oh, is it being married to you again?
Because I'd rather get euthanized.

Spoiler alert from <i>Marley & Me.</i>

480
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,182
That wasn't a spoiler until you said
the name of the movie.

481
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,852
If you've got a gig for me,
you can go through my new manager.

482
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,396
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.

483
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,942
Then what are you talking about?
Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!

484
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,112
How would you like to be the governor?

485
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,905
Whoa.

486
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,866

-Yes, of California.

Your first meeting's at 10:00,

-Thank you, Judah.
-Also, I have someone on line two

492
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,878
trying to get in touch
with BoJack Horseman.

493
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,381
I have no idea how she got this number.
It sounds like it's a teenage girl.

494
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,717
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.

Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. We can't help you.
