[Peanutbutter on recording]
Look alive, bright eyes.

2
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,311
It's the morning and somebody loves you.

3
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,855
Right back at you, buddy.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,648
-Oh, my God. He's here.
-There he is.

5
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,360
-I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-I love you, too.

6
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:31,824
Idea for a new Pixar movie:
what are pizza boxes thinking about?

7
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:34,660
-And Leland Stanford?
-Transcontinental Railroad.

8
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,788
-Transcontinental Railroad?
-That is correct.

9
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:41,083
Next question,
what is my favorite kind of berry?

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,502
-Barry Bostwick.
-Raspberry?

11
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,547
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry Bostwick.

12
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,216
-How was I supposed to know?
-He also likes Franken Berry.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,552
-We would have accepted Franken Berry.
-What?

14
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:53,888
-I'm sorry, you lose.
-What the...?

15
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,182
That's our show, but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:03,105
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:08,778
Idea for a new app: an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:15,451
-Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!
-Three months. A year. A life.

19
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:20,539
Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.

20
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,209
One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.

23
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,801
-Hey.
-[BoJack] Hey.

24
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:36,764
-You're still here?
-Yup. Still here.

[snoring, then grunts]

27
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,535
-Stop it.
-Wake up, captain dumbshit.

28
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,371
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.

29
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,165
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

30
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,459
Aah! What is it?

31
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,548
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

32
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,176
-Are you drunk?
-Only on adventure. And gin.

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,803
And vodka. And gin.

34
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,598
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.

35
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,518
-What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
-I don't know, ask Turteltaub.

36
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,521
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.

37
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,148
You've been here this whole time?

38
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,903
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do... Shut up.

39
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,696
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,822
[grunts] What orphanage?

41
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,867
Remember at Herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do

42
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:23,162
-with your Horsin' Around residuals?
-I do... not remember that.

43
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,581
You said, "Give it to an orphanage
or something."

44
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,167
-What?
-It turns out you made enough money

45
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,671
to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.

46
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,214
A hero?

47
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,135
That's right, a hero.

48
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,595
Or is it pronounced "gyro?"
I just call them subs.

49
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,848
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,
you're a great man.

50
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,018
Welcome to
The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.

51
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,938
Or, as we call it,
The BoJack Horsephanage.

52
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,439
You cannot call it that.

53
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:55,235
A, because I am not a great man and B,
because that is a really stupid name.

54
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,364
-The name was Molly's idea.
-Stop pissing off the orphans.

55
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,076
A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.

Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.

60
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:23,597
This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.

61
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,517
And it just goes to show you
life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,354
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.

63
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,315
-My parents are dead?
-No. No. Not necessarily.

64
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,359
Maybe they just didn't want you.

65
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,571
My point is,
I don't understand how people live.

66
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,033
It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning

67
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:46,829
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?

68
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,206
I don't know how.

69
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,457
Yay.

70
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,928
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser
must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

71
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,681
-And I'm not just talking about the butt.
-Ha.

72
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,894
Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?

73
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:14,232
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,
you don't come up with butt jokes.

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,402
You live truthfully in the moment
and the butt joke comes to you.

75
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,487
So true. So wise.

76
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,699
Listen, I need to "shove off,"
as we sailors say,

77
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,578
on my comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
I shan't be returning.

78
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,996
-Shan't you?
-I shannot.

79
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,708
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,
as my Number Two

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,586
and I don't mean that kind of number two.

81
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,714
What, number two, how do you do that?

82
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,803
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz
who cost me 50 grand.

83
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,099
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.

84
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,017
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

85
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,228
-We fixed the whole thing in post.
-Really?

86
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,689
Remember your first week, these nerds
made a computer scan of your head

87
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,608
so we could finish
if something happened?

88
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,193
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

89
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,238
Something happened to you,
so these nerds finished the movie.

90
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,782
Look what Computer BoJack can do.

91
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,701
-Help you out of that tree, ma'am?
-Look at him save that cat.

92
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,745
Now there's a protagonist
we can root for.

93
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,123
-You did all that in the computer?
-Not just that.

94
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:16,752
Computer BoJack had so much charisma
and screen presence we ended up going back

95
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,880
-and replacing you in every scene.
-I'm not in the movie at all?

96
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:23,634
Not technically, but computer you
is giving the performance of your career.

97
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,677
When people see what you do in this movie,

98
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,846
they are gonna storm
Daniel Day-Lewis's house,

99
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,432
schlep him out into the street,
shoot him in the head.

100
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,226
That's how good your performance is.

101
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,478
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis
look like shit.

102
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,731
-They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.
-But it's not my performance.

103
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:41,401
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.

104
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,696
Are you Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
We got a screening this weekend.

106
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,868
Come see the movie,
we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,

schlemiel, schlimazel,
Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

108
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,627
Just think, Carolyn,
in one week, all of this will be ours.

109
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,255
We should a put a social-media desk there.

110
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,175
If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas

111
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,303
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.

112
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,222
Smiling poop emoji,
I love everything about that.

113
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,934
I wanna make sure the couches
we get are really comfortable.

114
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:18,022
-Just in case we have some late nights.
-[laughs] Mr. Rabitowitz.

115
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,524
This is a place of business.

116
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,568
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?

117
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,989
I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,

118
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,033
-everything was going--
-Hold that thought.

119
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,075
What is it?

120
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,244
Ugh. My wife and I are going
to the ballet tonight,

121
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,121
there's a real ish
with the restaurant.

122
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,249
-This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
-You know how it is.

123
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,502
You say you want a divorce
and she says, "No, we can make this work."

124
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,422
You go to counseling and
remember why you fell in love with her

125
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,841
in the first place
and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

126
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,052
We've been sleeping together
for three months.

127
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,805
-We're about to start a company together.
-None of that has to change.

128
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,684
I am definitely going to divorce
her probably, it's just...

129
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,520
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone
who's never been married.

130
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,897
-Listen, this is--
-Oh!

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,982
Sorry, Katie just said something funny.

132
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,110
-What?
-I gotta hop. I love you, though.

133
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,661
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a-- Oh.

134
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,289
-Hey.
-Hey.

135
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:21,168
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

136
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,587
-Oh, where?
-The Giggleship.

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,215
It's the comedy cruise line
People magazine

138
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,428
-once called "a comedy cruise line."
-Comedy cruise line?

139
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,723
Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?

140
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,394
-It was two months ago. You missed it.
-Sorry.

141
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,770
-No, you're not.
-Well...

142
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,442
Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?

143
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,694
I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.

144
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,781
Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "Do you remember"

145
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,285
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

146
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,163
I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.

147
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,540
And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.

148
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,169
And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.

149
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,256
You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover

150
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,177
and also full from the pancakes
so instead... you took a nap.

151
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:17,224
And when you woke up, you said,
"Thanks for the pancakes.

152
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:20,811
-Now get out of my house."
-I don't remember any of that.

153
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,357
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.

154
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,902
Good. Honestly, you'll probably
be better off without me.

155
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,112
[sighs]

156
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,907
Yeah. But we had some good times,
though, right?

157
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,954
-Did we?
-Right. Well, um, take care.

158
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,666
Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, BoJack.

159
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,211
-I really do.
-Yeah, okay.

160
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,213
Hey, Todd?

161
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,635
You need to get your shit together.

162
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,639
-Ugh.
-Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.

163
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,143
I want you to come onboard
and write celebrity tweets.

164
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,645
-I don't know how to do that.
-You're a ghost-writer.

165
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,815
It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter

166
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,317
and more people read them.

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,403
All right, but why are you helping me?

168
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,948
Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people

169
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,825
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.

170
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.

171
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,205
I don't.

172
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,877
Welcome to my Giggleship.

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,589
For us, it's a place to realize
our higher selves. For the paying public,

174
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,676
it's a place to watch improv and drink
watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

175
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,721
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

176
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:42,226
No, no, you just get paid
in experience and stage time.

177
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,979
-Which in a way is even better than money.
-Say what?

178
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,315
Look, We've arrived
at your living quarters.

179
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,738
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.

180
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,822
That's the spirit.

181
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:59,243
And you can use improv to make
this room anything you want it to be.

182
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,038
My cabin is exactly like yours,
but when I use my imagination,

183
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,666
it becomes a rich stateroom
with a treasure chest full of booty.

184
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,546
I like a big booty, if you know what
I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

185
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,423
[laughing]

186
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:16,801
You really are the master
of spontaneous witticisms.

187
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,472
[sighs]

188
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,518
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.

189
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,311
-Oh, I am ready.
-Great.

190
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,148
Now let's get out there and tell all those
garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

191
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,734
what we really think of them,
once and for all.

192
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,279
Everyone. We have an announcement.

193
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,322
-[crying]
-Guys, we have an announcement.

194
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,618
-What's going on?
-Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,203
-He had a stroke.
-Oh.

196
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,164
Well, you know what you rat bastards
can stroke?

197
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,500
-Uh... Oh.
-My big, hairy...

198
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,709
[all gasp]

199
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,421
Well, we burned that bridge.

200
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,426
[both laughing]

201
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:02,306
Todd, you should be up a magician's
sleeve because you are a card.

[shouting]

203
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,393
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

204
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,563
-He refused to scrub the floors.
-Oh, Bryan.

205
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,399
Please. My knees were cramping
so I needed to stand.

206
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:16,570
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.

207
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:20,574
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.

208
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,993
I'm gonna go to Copernicus
and get this sorted out.

209
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,789
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus?

210
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,458
Huh?

211
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,377
Huh.

212
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,214
Whoa.

213
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,887
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes?

214
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,518
"No parking in the rear?"
[laughs] Aah!

215
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,771
-Copernicus is a fraud!
-A fraud? Me? Ow.

216
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,399
-Aah.
-I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

217
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,027
Normally, I'd make a perfectly
timed butt joke here,

218
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,946
but as you can see,
I don't have my book.

219
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,533
-Oh!
-Guards, take this subversive

220
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,284
to the Yes And room.

221
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,162
-No.
-Hey, what are you doing?

222
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,916
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my Trip Advisor review.

223
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,378
This cruise is getting three stars.

224
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,173
Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.

225
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,680
-Carolyn, we are free.
-Yeah.

226
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,848
Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.

227
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,892
I don't want to do that anymore.

228
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,229
-I told you, we can make this work--
-No. I don't want--

229
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,773
Carolyn, you're a single woman
in your 40s.

230
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,150
-Can you really afford to be picky?
-What?

231
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,904
I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy

232
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,698
who's gonna love you like I do?

233
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,409
Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?

234
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,452
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

235
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,538
If you're holding out
for something better,

236
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,124
well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're gonna be alone for a long time.

237
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,712
I'm not afraid of being alone.

238
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,673
And you might wanna find
someplace else to work

239
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:03,176
-because you're not coming with me.
-Wait, wait, wait, what?

240
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,721
It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.

241
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,348
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.

242
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:14,646
-Whoa, Carolyn, we just-- Come... Carolyn.
-My name is Princess Carolyn.

And as I held that baby in my arms,

244

I knew I had been given a second chance.

245
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:27,242
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time, I was gonna win...

00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,119
the race of life.

You should clear your schedule
for the next year.

Buckle up, buddy,
this is the year of Secretariat.

251
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,886
But it wasn't Secretariat.
And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

-Ana Spanikopita. Big fan.
-Thank you, it's--

256
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,357
I meant you are going to be
a big fan of me

257
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,777
because I am going
to win you an Oscar.

Ana is the best there is.

-Uh...
-We gotta get you on a talk show.

-So brave.
-Thank you.

Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?

-Feel that energy!
-They don't love me.

-They don't know me.
-That's why they love you.

270
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,186
He's right. Our research shows
America likes to think they know you,

271
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,272
and then they like learning more
about you, but at a certain point

272
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,735
they pass a threshold where they actually
know you and then they find you weird

273
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:44,944
and off-putting.

274
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,072
Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?

00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:22,292
-The batteries in the remote died.
-Did you check the junk drawer?

297
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,377
Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.

298
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,588
I'm gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.

299
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,758
-No, don't do that.
-Well, I'm out of options.

300
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:35,263
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here

301
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,142
-so you can help me find the batteries.
-Yeah?

302
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,479
I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,

303
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,274
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.

304
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,112
-Is that really what you want?
-Of course it is.

305
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:57,160
Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now

306
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,873
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.

307
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,543
-That sounds great.
-I love you.

308
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:09,714
I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.

309
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,634
There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.

310
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,471
[chuckles]
I guess I just have one of those faces.

311
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,389
[all shouting and laughing]

312
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:23,394
Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.

313
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,647
-Todd.
-Did someone say movie theater?

314
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,190
I heard movie theater.

315
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear
my giant hat to the movies.

316
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,114
Who's this sitting behind me?
John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.

317
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,952
-Todd, it's me, BoJack.
-BoJack?

318
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,039
-Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
-I can't leave.

319
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,456
I need to take suggestions.

320
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,002
Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.

321
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:53,967
You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.

322
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,760
You've been brainwashed into thinking

323
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,555
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.

324
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,474
If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion

325
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,851
and you'll run with it.

326
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,019
Huh.

327
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,188
Let's get out of here.

328
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,734
I'm afraid that getting out of here
is not an option.

329
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,153
-You've seen too much.
-What the hell are you gonna do about it?

330
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:17,574
-Stop you. With these.
-Oh, no.

331
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,201
-Don't do anything crazy, guys.
-You can't be serious.

332
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,620
-Just get behind me, BoJack.
-No sudden moves.

333
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,456
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.

334
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,919
Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

335
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,295
-I've lost them. Where did they go?
-Seriously?

336
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,174
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

337
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,344
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen

338
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,265
with SPF a million which protects
against flamethrowers.

339
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,767
Oh, no.

340
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,686
Now we finish this
with our strangle machine.

341
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,021
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

342
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:52,400
-Strangle those guys.
-Ugh! [coughs] BoJack, help.

343
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,568
[gasping]

344
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,154
There is literally nothing
happening to you.

345
00:19:56,237 --> 00:20:01,367
You don't understand, if you die
in improv, you die in real life.

346
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,038
So stupid. Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine?

347
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,706
Beep, boop, beep.

348
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,709
[gasps] No. I have a wife and children.

349
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,336
Well, they're improvised,
but they're real to me.

350
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,297
[all shouting]

351
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,510
-Can this be the end?
-This whole ship is full of idiots.

352
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,345
Beep, boop.

353
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,478
Come on, come on, come on.

354
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,855
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.

355
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,857
Wait. Where are you going?

356
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,735
Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,

357
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,573
but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.

358
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,284
Your friend?
I didn't realize this man was your friend.

359
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,370
Well, then, by all means,
go with him, Todd.

360
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,208
But, see, I thought this was the man
who sabotaged your rock opera.

361
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,421
The one who constantly abuses you and
makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

362
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,007
I invited him to.

363
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,760
The one who's never said a kind word
to you the entire time you've known him.

364
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:05,932
-Is this your friend, Todd?
-It's more complicated than that.

365
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:10,353
-Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
-More than that, we're a family.

366
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,191
-I, uh...
-Hash browns.

367
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,526
-What?
-I heard hash browns.

368
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,030
-Martha, did you see my hash browns?
-Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?

369
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:24,701
It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.

370
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,287
You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.

371
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,333
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

372
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,753
-But, you said, "I'll clean it up."
-And did I clean it up?

373
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,339
No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.

374
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,133
-Ha, ha.
-And you said,

375
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,676
"Thank you for letting me stay here.

376
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,388
I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,

377
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,433
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.

378
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,978
And I don't feel that way a lot.

379
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,523
Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

380
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,317
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.

381
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,154
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

382
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,159
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all
that up, that was some really good improv.

383
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,327
Game recognize game.

384
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,667
-Why do you have a boat?
-Uh, I don't remember.

385
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,212
[distorted ringtone playing on phone]

386
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,299
-Hello? Prince?
-Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

387
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,261
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.

388
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,305
-She says you know her, Jill Pill?
-Jill Pill?

389
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,267
Ring any bells?
Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

390
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,270
-Horsin' Around?
-No, actually. The other TV show.

391
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,522
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

392
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,650
I'm moving into the new office
and I got Herb's ashes here.

393
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,028
I really don't know what
to do with this thing.

394
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,988
-Do you want it?
-Yeah.

395
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,115
[smashing noise over phone]

396
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,700
Why did I take you with me?

397
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,247
Herb loved orphans.

398
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,125
Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines

399
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,960
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

400
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,921
And we will do our part
to honor his legacy.

401
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,881
-Hey, who's Jerb?
-What?

402
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,634
Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"

403
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,138
Your e-mail said "Jerb."
I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

404
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,807
-Is it not--?
-No, obviously that was a typo.

405
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,518
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

406
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,814
Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a Mediterranean restaurant,

407
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,940
but wouldn't finish.

408
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,526
And the waiter would say, "You want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

409
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,280
-And you'd say, "No."
-You gotta fix this.

410
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,699
Really? We spent a lot of money
on this plaque, you know?

411
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,161
-And on the t-shirts.
-Jerb's kids?

412
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,579
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

413
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,958
T-shirt's say Jerb
so I'm going by the t-shirts.

414
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,542
[groans]

415
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,672
You know, Herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny

416
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,926
-that you couldn't even get this right.
-Yeah. He would.

417
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,055
-So, in a way...
-Yeah.

418
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,849
You wanna get some
Mediterranean food?

419
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,893
You read my mind.

420
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,436
[panting]

421
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,774
Oh, God. Lungs on fire.

422
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,778
[groaning]

423
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:11,575
Ow. Crap. I hate this.
Running is terrible.

424
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,370
Everything is the worst.

425
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,871
[continues panting]

426
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,877
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

427
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,423
-It gets easier.
-Huh?

428
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,842
Every day, it gets a little easier.

429
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,054
-Yeah?
-But you gotta do it every day.

430
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,099
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.

431
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,268
