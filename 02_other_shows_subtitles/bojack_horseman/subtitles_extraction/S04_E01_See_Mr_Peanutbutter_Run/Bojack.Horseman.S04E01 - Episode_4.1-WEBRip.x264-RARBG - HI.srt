1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,633
[man] So you said let's do the show
about the horse,

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,779
- but this time without the horse.
- [woman] I know,

3
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:13,115
- [man] And I said, "That's a terrible idea."
- - [woman]  I'm sorry. I got...

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,378
And you said, "I got someone
even better." Hi guys.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,352
- What's this asshole's name again?
- Vincent D'Onofrio.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,021
- And here we are.
- [director] Okay. Action!

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,317
Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,779
- I forgot my boombox.
- And your deodorant.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,823
- Pee-yew, mister.
- [audience laughs]

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,285
- Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.
- Adopted, by me?

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,620
Children, I'm a single
breakdancing instructor

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,456
who can barely take care of himself.

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,126
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,836
[rhythmic grunting] Ooh!

15
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,130
And shake it up. Hah!

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,798
- [man coughs]
- Cut!

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,889
[klaxon blares]

18
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:53,928
It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomly
wander into doors all the time,

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,556
I never would have ended up
co-piloting the very plane

20
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,099
that brought me to Los Angeles.

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,644
Excuse me, didn't you see
the flashing red light outside the door?

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,105
Of course. That's why I stopped...

23
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,024
what I was doing to come inside.

24
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,108
[laughing]

25
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,487
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?
I love sitcoms!

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,947
You should have a character say,
"Talk to the hand."

27
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,865
[laughter]

28
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,534
The hand! Not the face,
where the ears are.

29
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,614
- Newsflash: hands can't hear.
- [laughter and applause]

30
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,414
What do you mean the character
needs to be more likable?

31
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,250
They don't teach likability
at the American Stanislavski Theatre.

32
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,877
Look, this is not about your acting.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,171
You don't want an actor,
you want a blank canvas

34
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,425
upon which to project your own
mawkish notions of goodness.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,345
Some man for all seasons
up for a bit of anything...

36
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,680
Cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,809
I assure you no such man exists.

38
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,019
But you're welcome to keep looking.

39
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,730
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.

40
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,898
- Hah hah!
- Hmm.

41
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,317
But my favorite scenes
are when a character

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,946
is completely oblivious to something
really important going on behind him.

43
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,491
That, dear friends, is where the sit
truly hits the com.

44
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,488
- Excuse me.
- Kind of in the middle of something.

45
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,740
- He's yakking away, tension's building...
- Hey, you, sir.

46
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,507
The audience is like,
"Hey, turn around."

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,535
Maybe the person behind him
even interrupts him...

48
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,626
- Can we talk to you for a second?
- Just like that.

49
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,380
And then, when it would be ridiculous
to go on even one second longer...

50
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,298
- My name is David Chase.
- Do you mind?

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,051
Only then does he say,
exasperated,

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,095
"What? What do you want?"

53
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,849
I want your face on billboards,
you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.

54
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,977
- Doggie-doggie what now?
- [laughter and applause]

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,190
Kid, how'd you like to be the star of
"Untitled Horsin' Around Knockoff"?

56
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,653
Me, a star? But I have
no experience, no formal training.

57
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,698
Hey, you, you don't need
any of those things.

58
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,950
You got "it."

59
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,286
Ohh...

60
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,371
[theme music playing]

61
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,303
[Diane] Hey, BoJack, it's me again.

62
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,472
[yawns] Hmm?
[groans]

63
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,807
I haven't heard from you
in, like, three months,

64
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,853
so I'm calling again
to make sure you're okay.

65
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,979
[overlapping chatter]

66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,397
What's new with me?

67
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,440
Well...

68
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,778
Monocle? No, I think
you're thinking of Mr. Peanut.

69
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,065
[Diane] I don't know if you heard

70
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,698
but Mr. Peanutbutter
is running for governor, kind of.

71
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,244
I want a comprehensive crisscross
of cold calls to Contra Costa County.

72
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,162
I mean, Christ, people, get me signatures.

73
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,249
First, they need to get Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,

74
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,251
which is basically impossible.

75
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,836
So that actually makes it really easy
for me to be supportive.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,171
- [smooching]
- [chuckles]

77
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,590
- How's the recall effort?
- Stupendous!

78
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,344
Uh, no. We're about 4,000 signatures shy
of stupendous,

79
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,845
and the deadline's in a week.

80
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,932
Even if you don't get all the signatures,
I'll still be proud of you.

81
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,891
Maybe even more so.

82
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,977
But when we do get
the signatures we need...

83
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,312
- Please note I said "when," not "if"...
- Noted.

84
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,941
Then the campaign will begin in...
oh, where did you say again, Katrina?

85
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,444
Earnest. When we get the signatures,
the campaign will begin in earnest.

86
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,613
Right. Earnest, California.

87
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,658
Earnest is not a city in Cal...
Why do I try?

88
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,702
Looks like you two
have everything worked out.

89
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,162
Just please note
that I am being supportive.

90
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,080
Noted!

91
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,285
[Diane] Most women wouldn't like
having their husband's ex-wife

92
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,876
hanging around all the time,
but I'm totally cool with it

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,170
because she makes me look
super chill by comparison.

94
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,922
Oh, uh... okay.

95
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,008
Anyway, call me back.

96
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,553
This is Diane, by the way.
Nguyen, obviously.

97
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,057
You sure you wouldn't rather
just play a governor

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,809
in a movie or TV show?

99
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,728
I could attach Tommy Schlamme
to direct.

100
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,272
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.

101
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,399
This is bigger than all that.
Don't you recall?

102
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,152
- Recall what?
- The governor. We need signatures.

103
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,612
Oh, sure.
Where do you stand on the issues?

104
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,825
Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issues
because he's not running for governor yet.

105
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,245
I'm mainly for people right now
and also for the future.

106
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,206
[groans]
Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.

107
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,667
Why don't you go get
signatures downstairs.

108
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,754
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.
She'll sign on to anything.

109
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,089
Judah! Can I get your John Wilkes Hancock?

110
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,342
Oh, I never developed a signature.
I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.

111
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,303
But I can print my name legibly.

112
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,805
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.
That'll do nicely.

113
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,600
- Okay.
- [groaning]

114
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,923
Ralph dropped this off for you.

115
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:57,482
"I always make a beeline
to see my feline." Aww!

116
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,569
Also, you wanted me to remind you about
FX's American Dead Girl miniseries.

117
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,947
Oh, that's right! What train wreck
are we rubbernecking at this year?

118
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,866
They're doing the Sarah Lynn story

119
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,702
and they're looking
for someone to play BoJack.

120
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,872
Oh! [retching, coughing]

121
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,375
Well, as I was saying, FX is looking
for a BoJack Horseman...

122
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,335
[retching, clearing throat] Ugh!

123
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,504
- Horseman... Ho...
- [retching]

124
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,215
- [moaning]
- So, as we discussed earlier,

125
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,801
is this one of the moments
where you would want privacy?

126
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,223
You know what I'd do
if I had eight million dollars?

127
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,470
- Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.
- Oh, no, no, no.

128
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,977
I mean, if I had
eight million dollars now,

129
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,648
I'd start a company that makes
remote-controlled drones.

130
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,068
But these drones have a seat
hanging from the bottom

131
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,903
so you can fly around in it.

132
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,657
A drone with a throne.
A drone throne.

133
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,409
But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone?

134
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,329
I feel like you're getting
really hung up on labels.

135
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,164
Well, anyways,
with my eight million dollars

136
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,668
I'm starting a new dating app
just for firemen

137
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,586
and redheaded women named Emily.

138
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,339
Aww, you don't need an app,
just hang out with me.

139
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,091
Todd, you're great.

140
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,717
What a way to end a sentence.

141
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,388
But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.

142
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,306
Whoa. Why did you call me that?

143
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,809
No, no, it's not bad.
I didn't mean it negatively.

144
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,438
- I was just, like, stating it.
- I'm not... that word doesn't describe...

145
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,982
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,
whatever you call yourself,

146
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,984
you're my friend and I support you.

147
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,195
But sometimes labels can be helpful.

148
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,616
Wow. Well, I would label
this conversation "rough".

149
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,368
Here's the check.

150
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,580
And this cow likes getting tipped.

151
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,294
[Diane] Hey, BoJack, it's me again,
voicemail number 17.

152
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,045
Did I tell you I'm working at a blog?

153
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,423
I wrote a story about
an all-girl refugee kickball league.

154
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,212
It didn't get as many clicks as Gillian's
story about how in certain pictures

155
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,131
you can see the outline
of Chris Hemsworth's penis

156
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,722
but, you know, we're all contributing
in our own ways.

157
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,725
Anyway, it's weird not having you around.

158
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,769
I hope you're okay, wherever you are.

159
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,278
"I'm so smitten
with my favorite little adult cat."

160
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,654
Oh! I love it.

161
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,114
I'm sorry I couldn't make it

162
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,159
to the Paul Blart 3: Till Death
Do Us Blart premiere last night.

163
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,494
I had a doctor's appointment.

164
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,121
- Whoa. Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

165
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,291
I don't like not knowing where you are,
especially when we live three freeways

166
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,376
and an unprotected left turn
away from each other.

167
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,379
I was thinking, what if you move
somewhere closer to me,

168
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,964
like into my house?

169
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,674
Oh. [stammers] Wow!

170
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,927
Would you, could you, with a mouse?

171
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,555
I... I could, and I would,
but it's not a good time.

172
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,848
Oh, okay.

173
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,392
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's fine. There's no hurry.

174
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,020
- We're still young, right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm super young.

175
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,606
Blake Lively accidentally
called me Mommy yesterday,

176
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,026
but I'm sure she does that
to other young women all the time.

177
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,364
[moaning, slurping]

178
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
[doorbell rings]

179
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,075
[gasps] Churro-flavored waffles!

180
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,493
- [doorbell ringing]
- Huh?

181
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,871
[gasps]

182
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,543
Drone Throne.

183
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,212
Whoa, whoa!

184
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,339
Okay, Todd. Whoa!

185
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,007
Oh, God, today's the day.

186
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,260
I haven't been this nervous
since Diane was vacuuming

187
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,881
during a thunderstorm
on the Fourth of July,

188
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,175
I had to take a bath,
and there was a stranger in our yard.

189
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,808
There's no need to be nervous,
or calm for that matter

190
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,059
because you've already lost.

191
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,437
We're 1,600 signatures short
and the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.

192
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
So it's gonna take a miracle, huh?

193
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,816
[buzzer blaring]

194
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,442
Oh, no! It's over.

195
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,195
Everyone can get out of my house now.

196
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,489
Ooh, tough break, kid.
We're all in shock.

197
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,741
McG! Are you still looking for a star

198
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,953
for your transgender Teddy Roosevelt
Planes, Trains and Automobiles reboot,

199
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,997
Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama?

200
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,873
Because someone just became available.

201
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,250
Whoa! Whoa!

202
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,252
I don't understand what happened.

203
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,547
Let me put it in terms
your dumb dog brain can comprehend.

204
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,717
All your life people have been
throwing you bones

205
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
because they like you,

206
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,429
but everyone has a ceiling
to their likability.

207
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:01,475
This is a bone you can't have,
because people just don't like you enough.

208
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,105
- I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- You know, it's funny.

209
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,233
Personally I like Woodchuck
and he's a fine governor,

210
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,445
but for some reason, even though
I have zero qualifications,

211
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,947
I honestly thought I would have made
an even better governor.

212
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,576
- Well, what matters is you tried.
- But I would have been good, right?

213
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,370
Now that there's no chance
you will ever be governor,

214
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,080
I can tell you honestly...

215
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,958
- Yes. You would have been great.
- [chuckles]

216
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,586
Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.

217
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,589
You care about people,
you follow your heart.

218
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,966
Those are important qualities
you should never give up on.

219
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,135
So what you're saying is
I shouldn't give up?

220
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,804
- On those qualities.
- Yeah. Never concede.

221
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,931
- Stick it out, stay in the race.
- Uh... no...

222
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,309
Uh, maybe we should get
Katrina's two cents on this.

223
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,478
- Katrina?
- Race. That's it, Diane!

224
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,313
You diabolical Thin Mint.

225
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:52,068
You, and only you, are responsible
for the great thing I am about to do.

226
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
Katrina?

227
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,531
- [applause]
- [deep breath]

228
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,658
Thank you, thank you.

229
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,620
Moments ago I found myself
in what seemed to be a no-win situation.

230
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,915
But it turns out
it was a "Nguyen situation."

231
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,210
I'm referring of course
to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,

232
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,254
- who told me to never give up!
- [groans]

233
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,133
And that's why I am challenging
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

234
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,136
- to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.
- What?

235
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,722
No more petitions
or fancy ballot initiatives,

236
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,434
just a mano a mano,
no-holds-barred slippery slalom

237
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,685
down an ice-covered peak.

238
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,480
Winner gets to be governor,
loser goes home.

239
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,524
Your move, Governor.
Mic drop!

240
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,317
- [feedback squeal]
- [cheers and applause]

241
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,778
- Aaah!
- [cheering]

242
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,905
[Woodchuck]
What the hell is he talking about?

243
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,617
It sounds like he's challenging you
to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

244
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,578
What an absurd conceit.
Do I even need to respond to this?

245
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,496
No, sir.

246
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,958
Because I'd rather focus
on my drought relief optimization

247
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,587
using geohydration technology,
or DROUGHT plan.

248
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,299
If I know anything, this story
will go away in a couple of days.

249
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,972
Now Mr. Peanutbutter, you challenged
Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.

250
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,933
Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash
down Devil's Mountain

251
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,936
- for the governorship itself.
- But still no comment from the governor.

252
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,897
Why won't he race you?
That's what I want to know.

253
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,482
You and me both, friendo.

254
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,236
But this isn't an us-ocracy,
it's a dem-ocracy.

255
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,822
- [audience] Ooh!
- So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.

256
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,616
- [cheers and applause]
- Any questions for the governor, folks?

257
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,703
[audience chants]
Why won't Woodchuck race?

258
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:30,332
So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan
is actually a drought relief plan.

259
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,043
I see now how that's confusing.
Any other questions?

260
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,879
Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?

261
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,715
Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?

262
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,426
To ski or not to ski?

263
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,928
That was the question
posed by William Shakespeare

264
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,347
and it's perhaps even more relevant today.

265
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,809
Of course, there are reasons
why a gubernatorial election

266
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,561
should not be decided by a ski race,

267
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,022
but are there also reasons
why it should?

268
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,732
For the sake of "fairness"

269
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,318
we've brought in two experts
with opposite opinions

270
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,820
who will now have equal time
to just say those opinions

271
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,281
because that's what news is.

272
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,783
You think they'll really race
down Devil's Mountain?

273
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,329
What do I care? As long as I've got
my giant bag of kettle corn,

274
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,372
that's the only thing that concerns me.

275
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,499
- [Todd grunts]
- [gasps]

276
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,668
- What the?
- Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!

277
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,170
Get back here with my kettle corn!

278
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,839
You can't call it a drone
if you're riding on it.

279
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,716
Suckers! Hooray!

280
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,176
Ha ha! Oh... oh, no!

281
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,720
Aw, man.

282
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,348
I was hoisted by my own petard,

283
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,185
the one petard I thought
would never hoist me.

284
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,812
[Woodchuck] Unprecedented poppycock.

285
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,773
This poppycock has no precedent.

286
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,734
Maybe it's time to make a statement.

287
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,985
Madeline, no.

288
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,696
This outlandish buffoonery
is beneath the office of the governor.

289
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,407
I can't defile the legacy
of my predecessors

290
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,661
who built the Golden Gate Bridge,
irrigated the Central Valley,

291
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,955
and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.

292
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,416
Can't you see this thing
is eating you alive?

293
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,212
Do it for us, Woodcharles.
Do it for us.

294
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,380
[groans]

295
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,970
And so this ski race would be both
undemocratic and unconstitutional,

296
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,891
which is why I will not be racing
Mr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.

297
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,769
What if the state constitution
were changed to allow it?

298
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,231
- Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?
- I... [sighs]

299
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,651
Fine. If a state senator
wanted to waste everybody's time

300
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,362
by sponsoring an amendment
to the constitution,

301
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,948
and the motion got two-thirds majority
in both houses

302
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,535
so as to allow
a democratically-elected governor

303
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,705
to accept a ski race challenge
for his office,

304
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,458
then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.

305
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,460
Well, I guess that puts
that idea to bed, right?

306
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,588
- Hmm.
- Right?

307
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,923
- Hmm... [chuckles]
- Right?!

308
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,931
You want me to sponsor a ski race
amendment to the constitution?

309
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,934
Or you could sponsor the amendment
that has a hidden rider

310
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,562
doubling farm subsidies in your district.

311
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,024
- Inglewood could use some farms.
- That's right.

312
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,902
I do have these campaign donors...
Uh, I mean, constituents

313
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,654
who really care about babies' access
to vaping devices.

314
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,489
- [coughing]
- Uh-huh.

315
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,035
I've always wanted to drive across
a bridge to Hawaii.

316
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,037
- Can we do that?
- You got it.

317
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,538
Aloha! [giggles]

318
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,832
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!

319
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,252
[chuckles] It tickles.

320
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,672
[sighs]

321
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,092
I'm astounded that it has come to this.

322
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,678
But since the exorbitantly expensive

323
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,642
and astonishingly titled I Love California
amendment is now law,

324
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,646
I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter's
challenge to a ski race.

325
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,397
It happens that I'm an excellent skier

326
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,150
who won numerous medals in the sport
when I raced for Dartmouth

327
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,653
but, again, I am shocked
that fact is relevant

328
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,238
in the matter of selecting
our state's governor.

329
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:53,452
Mr. Peanutbutter, I will see you
on Devil's Mountain.

330
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,996
- Whoa!
- This is insane.

331
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,874
You could actually become governor
by winning a race.

332
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,292
Yeah. Wow.

333
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,170
You know, it's days like this
I wish I knew how to ski.

334
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,383
- You don't ski?
- Never really got into it, no.

335
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,553
Then why did you challenge the governor
to a ski race?

336
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,168
[chuckles] I didn't think
it would get this far.

337
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,474
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.

338
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,394
Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.
Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.

339
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,689
No, this is not over.
This is just beginning.

340
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,317
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you're going to ski school.

341
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,611
Doggie-doggie what now?

342
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,780
[Diane] Hey, BoJack, it's me again.

343
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,990
Where are you, I'm worried,

344
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,633
hope you're not dead,
etc... you get it.

345
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,953
Anyway, things are even crazier
around here lately.

346
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,415
Don't know if you've seen the news,
but I really wish you were here for this.

347
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,459
Well, I'm off to ski school
so I can learn how to ski,

348
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,961
so I can become the governor.

349
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,421
[Diane] Y ou'd say something like,

350
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
"That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard."

351
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,258
Sounds great, sweetheart.

352
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,969
But as the old saying goes,
that's politics.

353
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,638
[Diane] Then you'd probably say,
"A, that's not an old saying

354
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,183
and, B, that's not politics!
Nothing about that is politics."

355
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,102
This is so great!

356
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,603
Then you would be so overwhelmed

357
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,772
by the unbearable ludicrousness
of the situation

358
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,108
that you would get in your car
and drive to Hawaii,

359
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,110
which is also a thing you could do now

360
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,904
because of a new bill
that cost our state billions of dollars.

361
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,614
It's all so great!

362
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,579
[sighs] You know, it's funny,
because the last time I saw you

363
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,790
you told me that you needed me
in your life,

364
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,333
and then you just disappeared.

365
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,085
So how do you think
that makes me feel?

366
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,381
Well, wherever you are,
I hope you're happy.

367
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,717
I really do, BoJack.

368
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,511
Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.
He's not with you, is he?

369
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,057
[munching]

370
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
Oh, simple kettle corn.

371
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,063
Between the worlds of the sweet
and the savory.

372
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,858
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.

373
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,402
- What are we?
- [cawing]

374
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,446
Hey, get away! Get, get!

375
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,781
[gasping, choking]

376
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,703
Wow, my first day at ski academy.

377
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,122
What collegiate shenanigans
will befall me?

378
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,542
There will be no shenanigans
on my watch.

379
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,877
Professor Thistlethorpe,

380
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,838
the famously humorless yet somehow
also lovable ski instructor?

381
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,592
Peanutbutter, is it?
Everything about you disgusts me.

382
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,510
Uh...

383
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,555
And yet, there might be
something in you after all.

384
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,890
You really mean it?

385
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,643
This shall be my greatest challenge.

386
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,270
Meet me on the summit
tomorrow at daybreak.

387
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,981
Well, it is daybreak
and here we are at the summit.

388
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,901
First lesson, break your skis in half.

389
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,320
Oh, I don't have skis.
Was I supposed to bring skis?

390
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,240
- You didn't say that.
- No bother. They shan't be required.

391
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,451
Instead, read this book of poetry.

392
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,204
I'll see you in the classroom.

393
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,833
Ah, there you are.
Did you read the book of poetry?

394
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,626
No! I forgot to.

395
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,753
- Excellent.
- I'm sor... Excellent?

396
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,630
My assignment was a test.

397
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,091
Skiing isn't about reading old books.

398
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,718
- It's about speaking truth to power...
- Oh!

399
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,304
And you have spoken it eloquently.

400
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,349
You are my finest student.

401
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,268
I love you.

402
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,561
[coughing]

403
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,896
- Are you okay, professor?
- Just a cough.

404
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,441
I'm sure it's nothing. You can come by
tomorrow for your diploma.

405
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,280
I can't believe ski school
is already over.

406
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,699
Professor Thistlethorpe?
Professor Thistlethorpe!

407
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,911
[weakly] Remember everything
I taught you.

408
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,996
I will.

409
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,040
Also, if you have any tips for skiing,
that would be really helpful.

410
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,627
The most important part of skiing

411
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,299
is to keep your legs ben...

412
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,052
[sobbing]

413
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,346
Who's Ben?

414
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,695
Devil's Mountain is the place,
skiing is the sport.

415
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,864
I'm uncomfortable.
It's cold out.

416
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,243
Tell me, who do you think
will win today's bout

417
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,363
and what does it mean
for the future of California?

418
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,870
I hate winter sports.

419
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,122
I want to go inside and drink a cider.

420
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,827
- [starter's pistol firing]
- And they're off!

421
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,251
[grunts, yelling]

422
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,087
[Tom] Woodchuck, off to a great start.

423
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,548
Mr. Peanutbutter seems to be employing

424
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,968
some sort of awkwardly
falling down technique.

425
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,721
- Any sign of them?
- Nothing yet.

426
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,265
- Oh! I made you a card.
- You did?

427
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,809
[chuckles] Oh, wow, it's sparkly.

428
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,895
Sorry, I went a little overboard
with the glitter

429
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,563
and a little underboard with the glue.

430
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,691
[Ralph] "Let's move in together.
I think I'm ready now."

431
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,944
This is great.
Are you sure, though,

432
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,696
because last time you seemed
a little hesitant.

433
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,699
- No, I was just a little pregnant.
- Oh!

434
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,992
I was gonna tell you, really,

435
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,787
but then before I could tell you
there was nothing to tell you.

436
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,996
Oh.

437
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,042
I'm so sorry. I still wish
you would've told me.

438
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,587
I have a card for that. On the front
it says, "Life isn't fairage."

439
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,549
I'm sorry. I just felt dumb
because all my life I've wanted a family.

440
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
But I didn't want it to happen
just because I got pregnant by accident

441
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,846
- and then you got stuck with me.
- Okay, first of all,

442
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:07,683
if I get stuck to something,
you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.

443
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,971
- You know what I mean.
- Second, if that's how you feel,

444
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,938
maybe you shouldn't get pregnant
by accident.

445
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,773
- Well, I didn't try to!
- No.

446
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,651
I'm saying maybe we should
get you pregnant on purpose.

447
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,069
- Really?
- Yeah.

448
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,697
We love each other,
and we enjoy having sex with each other...

449
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,573
And we're good
at having sex with each other.

450
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,535
And also, I think you'd be
an amazing mother.

451
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,871
- [sighs]
- Even Blake Lively thinks so.

452
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
Ah, still got it.

453
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,669
Yes!

454
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,920
[grunting, yelling]

455
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,338
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

456
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,009
Ohh! Get control.

457
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,720
Woodchuck in the lead,
still in the lead.

458
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,264
Woodchuck remains
very much in the lead.

459
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,891
Goodbye, dear friend.

460
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,810
You served me well.

461
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,396
[gasps] Okay, all right, here we go.

462
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
Mr. Peanutbutter?

463
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,775
Ohh! [yelling]

464
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,237
[grunting, gasping]

465
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,073
[yelling]

466
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,534
[gasping]

467
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,910
[panting]

468
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,078
I see Woodchuck!

469
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
Yes!

470
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,207
Go, Woodcharles!

471
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,460
Oh... whoa... [grunts] Whoa!

472
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,543
Oh, my God.

473
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,049
Todd forever!

474
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,759
Whaa!

475
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,344
- [crowd gasping]
- Ow, ow, ow, ow! [grunts]

476
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,265
- [crowd cheering]
- Invictus!

477
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,851
- [groaning, grunts]
- Ooh! Ooh.

478
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,729
- [moaning]
- Oh... ohh.

479
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,898
- Did I win?
- Come on, honey.

480
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,316
Let's go home.

481
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,119
- [applause]
- Well, I hope that settles it.

482
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,029
We can finally put an end
to this nonsense.

483
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,657
Sir, the rules are clear: the first person
to cross the finish line becomes governor,

484
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,952
and, well, a strange boy
fell out of the sky

485
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,579
and crossed the line first.

486
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,164
They're swearing him in now.

487
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,876
- So help me Todd.
- Congratulations, Governor Chavez.

488
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,336
[cheers and applause]

489
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,506
You know, ever since
I first became governor

490
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,800
I've thought,
"I don't want to be governor"

491
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,635
and that's where I am now.

492
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,845
So, can I not be governor?

493
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,971
[groaning and gasping]

494
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,306
You'd like to resign?

495
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,226
Yeah. I'm just really not
into labels right now.

496
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,813
Maybe after some soul searching
I'll be ready to really know what I am.

497
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,733
But for right now,
I think I speak for all Californians

498
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,861
when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn

499
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,324
while drifting through the sky
on an out of control drone throne."

500
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,327
Okay, is this charade over?
Can I be governor again?

501
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,163
Sir, we live in a society of laws.

502
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,291
When a governor resigns,
that triggers a special election.

503
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,128
Until which, the governor's seat
shall remain vacant.

504
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,421
- [all gasping]
- Election, you say?

505
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,966
Mr. Peanutbutter, will you run?

506
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,885
- You bet I will, and you know why?
- No, tell me.

507
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,972
Because this whole ski race was a joke.

508
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,975
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.

509
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,727
So where's the candidate
for regular schmoes like me,

510
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,313
- who went to Northwestern?
- Is he serious right now?

511
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,024
You know, Governor Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz

512
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,902
thinks he's better than us,
but is he better than us?

513
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,071
- [crowd] No!
- Uh, if I could say a few words...

514
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,656
He thinks the race is over.

515
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,367
Well, I say it's just starting.

516
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,787
And he wants me to sit and stay
and roll over?

517
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,541
- No!
- I say California's tired of rolling over.

518
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,585
What do you say?

519
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,211
- [crowd] Yeah!
- [woman] I'm tired.

520
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,464
I say it's time for me
to stand up and speak.

521
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,341
- [cheering]
- Diane-Diane what now?

522
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,136
So loud as you can,
let me hear what you want.

523

[chanting] Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

524
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141

525
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,311
Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

- Friends, some decorum, please.
