That feeling is you selfishly
trying to assuage your guilt.

151
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,724
If you cared about Todd,
you would keep this a secret forever.

152
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,975
I'm not good at lying.

153
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,146
Ask me if when I was a little girl,
did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

154
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,231
in my underpants
and rock back and forth on it.

155
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,900
When you were a little girl,
did you ever do that thing you said?

156
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,486
What? Get-- [stammers] No!

157
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,240
I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up?

158
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,367
Not like there's any reason
the three of us

159
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,327
would ever be in a room together again.

160
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,288
BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

161
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,249
-I've never seen you before in my life.
-No.

162
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,085
-You don't remember BoJack?
-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

163
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,338
What... why... What are you here?
Why are you doing at Todd's house?

164
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,923
Todd's house? This is my house.

165
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,594
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?

166
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,220
What? Why would that be weird?

167
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,222
-What are you implying?
-Nothing.

168
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,309
It's not weird for me either,
if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

169
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,688
-Okay, what is going on here?
-Why would you? I don't even--

170
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,982
-Literally nothing going on.
-No, something's going on.

171
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,650
I've got a nose for news.

172
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,528
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable

173
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,946
for "What Is Going On?"

174
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,240
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

175
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:39,079
I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.

176
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,457
-That's crazy.
-I know what it is.

177
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,334
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

178
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,462
No one wants to say it out loud
because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

179
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,006
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

180
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,675
Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.

181
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,260
-Yes.
-Glad that's out in the open.

182
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,888
We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask

183
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,099
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.

184
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,016
Nope.

185
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,228
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.

186
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,479
Great idea.

187
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,649
The worst part is things have actually
been going really well with Todd.

188
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
Our friendship is in a really good place.

189
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,777
Last week he said,

190
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,613
"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

191
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,574
Instead of saying,
"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

192
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,827
[The Closer] <i>So, why did you</i>
<i>sleep with Emily?</i>

193
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>Do you think that part of you was getting</i>
<i>uncomfortable with that closeness?</i>

194
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,500
<i>You felt like you didn't deserve</i>
<i>Todd's friendship</i>

195
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,546
<i>and you wanted to somehow</i>
<i>externalize that feeling into action?</i>

196
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,174
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that?

197
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,717
When you do bad things,

198
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,471
you have something you can point to
when people eventually leave you.

199
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,308
It's not you, you tell yourself,
it's that bad thing you did.

200
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</i>

201
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,523
<i>Are you afraid of being known</i>
<i>and knowing others?</i>

202
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah, you know, I think that you're
definitely hitting on something real

203
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,570
that I would love to drill down into,

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,030
but I gotta go
to this marketing meeting now.

205
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,200
Which is so annoying
because I totally want to keep talking

206
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,952
about that thing you're talking about.

207
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,537
But marketing meetings, right?

208
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,290
I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

209
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>-Of course.</i>
-Great. Bye.

210
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,255
<i>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</i>
-Weird.

211
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,466
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. We're just getting started.

212
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,093
I had the worst morning.

213
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,845
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

214
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,263
So I drove here, right?

215
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,350
<i>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</i>
<i>when I realize I don't have my key card.</i>

216
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>

217
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,272
<i>When I got there,</i>
<i>I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

218
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,525
<i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>
<i>I put it in the glove compartment.</i>

219
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>

220
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,904
Okay.

221
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,198
Because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.

222
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,742
I pulled into a 76.

223
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,870
I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,

224
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,122
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home

225
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,708
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

226
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,626
Diane...

227
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,337
Have you donated
to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

228
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,340
-Oh, shit.
-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

229
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,051
Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.

230
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,386
Does the world need
a stop-motion short film

231
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,263
about a pig who goes to circus school?

232
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,141
Think of it like you're doing
a nice thing for your friend.

233
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,643
Mmm... okay.

234
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>I called a cab to take me home</i>
<i>to get my credit card.</i>

235
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,066
Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.

236
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,193
So that's why I'm late.

237
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,154
-Why did you tell us that whole story?
-I don't know.

238
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,325
-Why did you tell me that whole story?
-I don't know.

239
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,038
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up
some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.

240
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,041
Good news is the movie
is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

241
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,669
If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?

242
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,046
These are
the "For Your Consideration" ads.

243
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,841
They're a reminder to the Academy,
"Have you considered this yet?"

244
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,427
The Academy doesn't always
consider everything.

245
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,972
So they need constant
consideration reminders.

246
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,182
-That's very considerate.
-This one tested the best.

247
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,434
That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.

248
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,812
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

249
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,939
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

250
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,608
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

251
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,694
-I am really good at this.
-Huh.

252
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,823
-I kind of like this one.
-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

253
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,074
We ruled that one out.

254
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,575
It's actually really powerful.

255
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,537
[The Closer] <i>What spoke to you</i>
<i>about </i>that <i>particular ad?</i>

256
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,913
[BoJack] <i>I don't know.</i>

257
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,582
<i>All the pictures of me,</i>
<i>they looked backwards.</i>

258
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>When I looked at the mirror ad,</i>
<i>I was seeing me as I see myself</i>

259
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>there was something beautiful about that.</i>

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,382
<i>Intimate, almost.</i>

261
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,634
Of course you like this ad.
When you look at it

262
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,678
you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

263
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,098
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?
No? You're just some old turtle?

264
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,935
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."
-But you've got the heart of a champion.

265
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,396
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars
who say different.

266
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,190
Isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?

267
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,527
The point of the movie is to make
a lot of money and win awards.

268
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,779
If anyone who looks at this ad
is Secretariat,

269
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,406
why should you win the Oscar?

270
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,869
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you
leave this to the experts, okay?

271
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,082
-Yes. You're a star.

<i>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</i>

273
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,921
[BoJack] <i>Yeah, couple times.</i>
<i>We have a very complicated relationship.</i>

274
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,214
It's complicated.

275
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,093
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep
movie, it would be <i>Doubt.</i>

276
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,888
Don't forget, you have <i>Ellen</i> tomorrow.

277
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,514
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

278
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes. You're in charge.

279
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,979
Okay, you know, I gotta say
I don't feel like I'm in charge.

280
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,648
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,
forget the whole thing.

281
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we
having sex in my car?

282
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,196
-Can we at least go back to your place?
-No, BoJack.

283
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,864
I don't know where you live.

284
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,992
You control every part of my life,
I don't know anything about you.

-You don't want to know me, BoJack.
-No, I do.

287
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,457
-I want to be known and know others.
-You don't.

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,004
I know you and I know what you want.
This is exactly what you want.

<i>What do you think she meant by that?</i>

290
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,259
Better question:
Why am I still getting the <i>L.A. Gazette?</i>

291
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:50,431
Do you think getting the paper every day
is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

292
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,352
<i>The project he abandoned</i>
<i>to make time for the old girlfriend</i>

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,528
No. I want to cancel my subscription
because newspapers are dumb.

296
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,446
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

297
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,740
Every morning,
someone knocks on my door and says,

298
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,367
"Throw away this garbage for me."

299
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,453
So you don't feel any guilt
about your tryst with Emily?

300
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

301
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,749
[Emily and Todd laughing]

302
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,459
[Todd] You're silly.
[Emily] No, you're silly.

303
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,460
Oh, God.

304
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,380
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
-Truth.

305
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:27,093
What is the worst recent thing you did
to someone who cared about you?

306
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,805
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?
-Both.

307
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,641
Can you keep it down, please?
Some people are trying to sleep.

308
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,852
-We are keeping it down.
-We've been really quiet.

309
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,395
-You're basically shouting.
-Sorry.

310
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,858
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?
-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

311
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,068
No, because then I'll hear the
"psst, psst, psst."

312
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,779
And I'll be up all night
wondering what you're talking about.

313
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,615
-Uh, what would we be talking about?
-Yeah, BoJack.

314
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,659
What would we be talking about?

315
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

316
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,205
Forget it. Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.

Well, Margo, old gal,

330
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,258
looks like you've bought yourself
another day of freedom.

331
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,177
But at what cost?

332
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
I knew I had to lay low.
Go off the grid, disappear.

333
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,182
I know what "lay low" means.

I have ambition, sir.

Dreams that don't incorporate
the concerns of cynics like you.

341
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,291
Cynic.
Always laughing that terrible laugh.

-Ramona...
-Well, go ahead and laugh.

And you've been living here ever since?

353
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,080
That's right. I also did an arc
on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

-Other than that, laying low.

How did you go on a nationally broadcast
TV show with no one catching you?

356
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:11,424
I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting. Try it sometime.

357
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
And you're the one
who's been stealing our food.

Hi-yah!

-Why did you throw a plum on the floor?
-Thought it was a smoke bomb.

Where are my smoke bombs?

-Hey. BoJack's back.
-Yup.

-You bet.
-Isn't this great, BoJack?

-The three of us under one roof?
-Yeah.

367

It's like <i>Three Men and a Baby.</i>

But there's only two men,
and the baby's a lady.

something you can depend on.

about the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

378
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>I don't think you finished the story</i>
<i>about your publicist.</i>

379
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,115
What happened when you told her
you wanted to know her?

380
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,367
Oh, right. Well...

381
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,536
If we're gonna work together
and also have weird kinky car sex,

382
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,080
I wanna know something about you.

What do you wanna know?

384
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,209
I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.

-My favorite fruit is honeydew.
-Gross, is that true?

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,046
Does it matter?

387
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,131
Listen, I've been
with guys like you before,

388
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,468
and I know this thing works better
if we keep a little distance.

00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,511
And...

390
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,806
-[groaning] Well, that worked.
-Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

[The Closer]
<i>So, that's how you left things?</i>

392
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,687
[BoJack] <i>That's how she left things.</i>
<i>But then I followed her home.</i>

393
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,063
[The Closer]
<i>You did what?</i>

394
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,607
[BoJack] <i>She lives in this</i>
<i>tiny apartment in the Valley.</i>

-About what?

<i>your self-destructive behavior.</i>

You know that old joke
about how many psychiatrists

409
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,399
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
The answer is just one,

410
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,860
but the light bulb has to want to change?

411
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,988
-I don't know that joke.
-That's it. That's the whole joke.

412

The light bulb has to want to change.

413
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,744
[laughing]
Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

-What the... I'm on the phone.

On the phone.

421

I don't want to talk to anybody.

to please cancel my delivery

-I don't think you want to do that.
-I promise you I do.

427
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,319
No, because that's just theater.

428
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:23,532
It allows you to think you're in control,
but the whole idea of control is a myth.

429
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,951
The universe is a wild beast.

<i>All you can do is try to live inside it.</i>

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,042
Live inside the beast?
That's a mixed metaphor.

-But... you're right.

I've been thinking,
and you should do this without me.

445
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,127
What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.

446
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,879
But you don't need me anymore.

447
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,631
You have a whole team of coders,

448
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,717
and I don't think that I can work
in this house.

Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?

453
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,230
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

BoJack? [sighing]
What did he do this time?

455
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,905
I don't think
I've been a very good friend to you.

Things happened and...

457

I don't think BoJack's been
a very good friend to you either.

458
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,208
-Oh, okay.
-You should buy me out of the company.

459
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,210
No, no, no, keep your share.

460

Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.

You're sweet, Todd.

462

You shouldn't waste that on people
who don't deserve it.

Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.

-Ana...
-You need to leave.

471
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,777
No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,

472
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,112
but control is a myth.

473
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,656
That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.

474
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,824
I can't do this now.

I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,

I wanna see what
you look like waking up.

You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.

And you don't have to be, either.

Okay.

This is my campaign,

Call up Turteltaub and tell him
I won't be pushed around on this.

I'm the star and what I say goes.

a billboard for the sky.

-No kidding.

The sky is Secretariat? The sky
wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,828
It is eerily beautiful.

493
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,456
Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.

Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad
for my movie to be interpretable.

you see a reflection
of the KIIS-FM billboard.

Beautiful. So we spent half a million
dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.
