00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,227
- [Diane] <i>No. I'm just on--</i>
- Why wouldn't you tell me?

154
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,687
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

155
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>I just... I feel safer when I know</i>
<i>that I know where you are.</i>

156
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,985
- I affirm your feelings...
- [BoJack] <i>I don't want to--</i>

157
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,528
...your feelings have value,

158
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,073
but I'm not in New York,
I'm just on the conference call.

159
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,158
- Guys, can we...
- [Peanutbutter]<i> I feel heard.</i>

160
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,869
- [Diane] <i>I hear that you feel heard.</i>
- What the hell is happening?

161
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,122
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!
- <i>What?!</i>

162
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,417
[Todd] <i>As Carrie from</i>
Sex and the City <i>might say...</i>

163
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,796
<i>- I'm Carrie.</i>
- [Peanutbutter] <i>Todd? In the naked city?</i>

164
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,467
[chuckling] <i>That is going to lead</i>
<i>to some wackiness. You mark my words.</i>

165
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,429
Would you guys literally mark my words?
I do want to refer back to this later on.

166
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,390
We're in the middle of a meeting!

167
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,184
[Peanutbutter] G<i>ot to go.</i>
<i>It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.</i>

168
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
Right?

169
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,939
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research
on J.D. Salinger.

170
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>Rabbit, Run?</i>

171
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,818
- <i>That's Updike, you illiterate.</i>
- What's Updike?

172
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,861
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

173
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,571
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

174
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,949
<i>Has it been reclaimed?</i>
<i>I honestly can't keep track.</i>

175
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,577
- Who are you asking?
- [Ana] <i>We're hanging up now, goodbye.</i>

176
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,123
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.

177
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,210
I want to find one of those fortune
telling robots that can make me big!

178
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,128
[groans]

179
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,673
Hey, champ,
I have a very important job for you.

180
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,591
Why don't you go get us some ice?

181
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,301
You don't need to patronize me.

182
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,556
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.
- [BoJack] Don't get lost, buddy!

183
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,682
I'm not gonna get lost.

184
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,393
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

185
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,191
Oh, no.

186
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,777
Hello? Are you still there?

187
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,905
- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.

188
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,658
I just got promoted
to head of programming.

189
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,911
I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry

190
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,164
that is broadcast television.

191
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,499
- I'm a captain!
- What happened to Wanda?

192
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,626
You didn't hear? She got poached.

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,754
- Oh, God!
- By another company.

194
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,755
Oh, good.

195
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,506
- They shot her.
- Oh, God!

196
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,675
Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!

197
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,054
- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.

198
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,474
- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

199
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,601
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

200
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,020
Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,

201
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,023
thanks to the runaway success
of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

202
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

203
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,737
Not to mention its companion show
<i>Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

204
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,322
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</i>

205
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>With Chris Hardwick.</i>

206
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,534
- So as long as you two stick around...
- I'm taking the show off the air.

207
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,495
Wait, what? Why?!

208
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,538
I told the story I wanted to tell.

209
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,875
To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.

210
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,793
Uh...

211
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,671
At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

212
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,048
- and what they don't know.
- [moaning]

213
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
- Did they know things?
- [whimpers]

214
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,676
- Well, we found out.
- This is a nightmare.

215
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,137
Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

216
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,348
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

217
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,143
I <i>am </i>no Christopher
from the Tesla dealership.

218
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,526
Is this as good as it gets?

219
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,781
Or are we living in the ghost town
where once my career did blossom?

220
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
Who will speak my name
when I am gone?

221
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,747
Who will sing lamentations
for he who once talked soup?

222
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,668
- [groans]
- What legacy of ruin am I left with?

223
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,630
What rewards have I reaped
for the damage done?

224
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,925
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

225
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,096
but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

226
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,848
[sobbing]

227
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,227
[gasps and growls]

228
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,687
But before you fold the omelette,

229
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,607
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up
and whisper his or her dreams into it.

230
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,069
Whisper dreams into omelette.

231
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,572
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

232
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,241
You look different. Older. A lot older.

233
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm not saying you look bad,
just much, much, much older.

234
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,245
Thank you, Jill.

235
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,581
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers
recently, have you?

236
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,458
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.

237
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,793
I worry about him.

238
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,296
About six months back, he disappeared,

239
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,589
stopped returning my calls.

240
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,593
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?

241
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,928
Promise me you'll check on him
when you get back to L.A.

242
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,681
Maybe swing by his house?
I think you owe him that much.

243
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,641
Fine. Listen, about the play...

244
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,311
<i>The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,</i>
a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

245
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,354
- Right.
- That's dead. Over.

246
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
A thing that happened
that happens no longer,

247
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,691
- like a whimper in the wind.
- Okay.

248
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,779
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

249
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,782
And the void says,
"Stop shouting at me, please!"

250
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,536
And we grab the void and we spit
in its face, "Sir, I will not."

251
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,413
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

252
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,583
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you,

253
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,003
BoJack Horseman,
completely naked and covered in milk.

254
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,047
- I'll stop you there.
- It's a symbol for rebirth.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,007
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

256
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,468
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.

257
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,012
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,

258
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
or edgy, or covered in milk.

259
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,768
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.

260
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,146
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.

261
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,273
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

262
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,275
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

263
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,694
people will still be able
to see me in <i>Secretariat.</i>

264
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,446
- And then what?
- And then...

265
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

266
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,244
- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.

267
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,413
- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,499
You know what the real tragedy
of <i>Greg KingLear </i>is?

269
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,167
Two hours long without an intermission?

270
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,627
It's that he's a marionette.

271
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,089
And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.

272
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,008
Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

273
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,468
This does not taste like dreams.

274
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,557
You told me I would be getting
more attention at a smaller agency,

275
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,601
but if anything, I'm getting less.

276
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,145
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

277
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,815
I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...

278
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!

279
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,403
I'm taking my business
to Gekko Rabitowitz.

280
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,862
What? No!

281
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,033
J.D. Salinger is too big a star to be
hamstrung by some rinky-dink operation

282
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,952
working out of a two-story warehouse.

283
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,538
I need an agency
with at least nine stories.

284
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,580
Uh...

285
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,876
That was a reference to my work,
with which you are clearly not familiar.

286
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,211
- Oh...
- Goodbye.

287
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,672
Hello to you, Rasputin.

288
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,466
- Give my regards to the czar.
- I will relay the message.

289
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,469
Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

290
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,056
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

291
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,809
I believe I can take on
more responsibility around here.

292
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.

293
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,732
But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.

294
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,358
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

295
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,319
we should focus on better gigs
for the clients we already have.

296
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,698
- Oh. Like <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>
<i>- </i>Yes.

297
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,326
- What part of <i>Jerry Maguire</i>?
- The part where Tom Cruise's agent

298
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,455
got him a massive payday

Okay, walk me through it again?

I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!

454
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,322
Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.

I'm aware of the situation
and I'm handling it.

- But I haven't even--
- I'm handling it.

00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,631
I'll see you at the screening tonight.

There you are. Stay right there.

<i>All right, Oxnard.</i>

471
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,906
We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

472
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,033
Too bad Todd's not here.

473
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,076
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas

474
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,245
that at first might seem terrible...

475
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,581
Right.

476
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,042
If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,

477
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,836
"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"

478
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,129
Go on.

479
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,382
And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."

480
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,551
Hah! That is so me!

481
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,221
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

482
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,641
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"

483
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,228
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

484
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,021
That is a brilliant idea!

485
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,148
That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!

486
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,775
Put that in the maybe pile.

487
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,819
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.

488
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

<i>A Spaghetti Strainer</i>
<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>

That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

491
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,578
No! Nobody's done anything.

492
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,040
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

493
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,292
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

494
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,212
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.

495
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,423
- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

I took care of our problem.

00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,142
What did you do?

500
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,771
You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.

501

Ana...

502
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,775
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...

503
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,696
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--

504
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,574
And then after, I was relieved.

505
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

506
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,413
- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.

507
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,164
I was in New Mexico.

508
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:58,127
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.

509
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,212
We get to decide what our story is.

510
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,299
Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.

511
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,342
- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.

512
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,263
This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.

513
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,517
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.

514
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,313
You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.

515
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,566
But that night is a really good night.

516
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,404
I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.

517
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Do you want that?

518
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,950
Yes, I do.

could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?

- Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.
- [laughter]

than just a dumb TV actor.
