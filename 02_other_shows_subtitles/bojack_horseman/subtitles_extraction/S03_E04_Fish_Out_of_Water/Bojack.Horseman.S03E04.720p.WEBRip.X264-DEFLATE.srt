1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,224
Why do I have to go to this thing?

2
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,726
If we want to be
a legitimate awards contender,

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>Secretariat </i>needs to make an appearance
at a big festival.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,106
-I can't just go to Cannes?
-You Cannes not.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,359
Apparently, the French do not care for you

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,486
ever since you said that thing
in the press.

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,696
Hey, I stand by my critique of Sartre.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,825
His philosophical arguments helped
tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty.

9
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,494
Also, the French smell and I hate them.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,789
And you can't go to Sundance
because Robert Redford hates you.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,625
Someone had to tell him
<i>The Horse Whisperer </i>was offensive.

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,461
Sorry, but real horses don't just do
whatever someone says.

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,256
And that's why you need to go
to this festival.

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,882
If you say so.

15
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,510
The Pacific Ocean Film Fest, or POFF,

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,972
is the biggest underwater film festival
in the world.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,308
You make a splash there,
people are going to notice.

18
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,309
Fine.

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,521
All you need to do is get
to the premiere on time, 8:00.

20
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,983
Walk the red carpet, wave at the crowd,
kiss some fish babies.

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,943
Fish. They're so annoying.

22
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,238
Sorry, lady. No <i>habla </i>fish talk.

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,992
You need to be sensitive to their culture.
Things are different down there.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,369
You know what a thumb's up means, right?

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,955
Yes, I know what a thumb's up means.
I'll be fine.

26
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,790
Oh, I wanted to warn you.

27
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,294
Kelsey Jannings
is also going to be at the festival.

28
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,379
-Kelsey? No.
-She has another film there.

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,007
I haven't talked to her
since she got fired from <i>Secretariat.</i>

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,844
Well, luckily you won't have to talk much
because you'll both be underwater.

31
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,013
God, I haven't been underwater

32
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,932
since my mother tried to drown me
in the bathtub when I was 22.

33
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,018
I can't do this, Ana. I'm sorry.

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,436
-Sir.
-I'm getting off.

35
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,314
You can't.
We've already pressurized the cabin.

36
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,942
-Sir, please return to your seat.
-No. I don't want to do this.

37
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,193
You can't make me.

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,154
I'm a land creature.
I don't belong down there.

39
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,364
You can lead me to water,
but you cannot make--

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,574
Aaaah!

41
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:09,630
