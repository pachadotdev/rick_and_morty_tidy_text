I think that we bring out

00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:07,965
the best in each other.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,302
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,554
Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof.

Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo.

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,066
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type,
and I'm visiting the set

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,319
of Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.

9
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,946
I'm thrilled to be talking
to the star of the film,

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,949
BoJack Horseman, and his
real life inspiration,

11
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,159
Mr. Peanutbutter.

12
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,868
Am I an inspiration?

13
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,496
Well, that depends on how you define...

14
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,872
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.
- Ugh.

15
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,041
You know, I'm just over
the moon to be producing

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,544
this movie about my daring exploit.

17
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:48,547
- Yes, your daring exploit.
- Yes.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,342
It's such a treat to be
shooting in my very own casa.

19
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:55,220
And it's an even sweeter treat
to be played by my good amigo...

20
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,805
dare I say best amigo?

21
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,682
- You "daren't."
- We're so in tune.

22
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:03,521
We even finish each other's...

23
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,439
sentences.

24

Sometimes it doesn't happen.

25
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,983
- It never...
- Happens.

26
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,610
Ah, see? I'm inside him.

27
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,863
BoJack, you haven't
worked in quite some time.

28
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,739
In fact, I thought you were dead.

29
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,868
You must be so grateful to be
working again and also alive,

30
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,911
which, again, I thought you were not.

31
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:21,330
How did you get involved with this?

32
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:22,581
Well...

33
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,748
You want me to play Mr. Peanutbutter

34
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,544
in the story he stole from me?

35
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:27,919
I stole the D,

36
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,880
and then he stole my stealing of it.

37
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:32,383
That makes him an idea
thief, which is much less cool

38
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,385
than a thief thief, which is what I am

39
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:35,469
and what he also is.

40
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,928
You know what might help?

41
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,389
If you think about this like a professional

42
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:40,015
instead of a big titty baby.

43
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,184
This movie is a huge opportunity.

44
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,687
Quentin Tarantulino is known
for revitalizing dead careers.

45
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,689
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs

46
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,024
did for Rin Tin Tin.

47
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:50,650
But isn't there any other part?

48
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,403
I could play myself.

49
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,572
No, BoJack's already being
played by Wallace Shawn.

50
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:56,198
What? The short guy from The Princess Bride

51
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,533
who says "inconceivable"?

52
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,868
- Why Wallace Shawn?
- BoJack Horseman?

53
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,245
I don't want to play that boob.

54
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,871
I'm trying to help you out, Wally.

55

You're the one who keeps
buying expensive Rothkos.

56
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,251
I have a disease.

57
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,629
Would you tell an alcoholic
to stop buying alcohol?

58
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,756
You know, Black and Blue Number 7's

59
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,299
going up for auction next week.

60
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:15,842
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

61
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,636
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

62
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,888
But if you find me in a bathtub
with open wrists tomorrow

63
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,349
and the words "I hate my
agent" smeared across the walls

64
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,101
in blood, you'll know why.

65
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:27,729
So obviously I'm thrilled
to be here, just thrilled.

- Was she your waitress?
- Yes.

88

- Was she also your waitress?

actually spend time with you,

00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:33,684
- I do not.
- I just think if we're telling

162
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,853
the story, we should tell
it how it really happened.

163
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,229
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

164
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,106
Right...

165
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,566
because of the shirts.

166
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,234
Because I'm the one who stole the D.

167
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:44,569
I'm the real hero here.

168
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,237
My life is full of exciting adventures.

169
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,322
I should write a book.

170
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,990
Oh, wait. I did.

171
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:50,617
Suck on that, society.

172
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,160
Hey, you're in a mood.

173
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,871
Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck

174
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,955
is cutting off circulation to the brain?

175
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,666
Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe.

176
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,167
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

177
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,251
Donna!

178
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,089
What are you doing?

179
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:08,259
I'm just trying to get inside
my character, which is you.

180
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,761
Is this how we move our arms?

181
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,221
We're so weird.

182
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:12,514
Is this really necessary?

183
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,140
Is this really necessary?

184
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,433
That's not what I sound like.

185
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,268
That's not mut mi sound mike.

186
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,270
Hey, what's it been like
since we got married?

187
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:21,648
Is it everything we dreamed
of since we were little?

188
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,567
When I was little, I dreamed of getting

189
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,694
a MacArthur grant for my
'zine about how all the girls

190
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,195
at school were bitches.

191
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,656
- Oh.
- Look, the wedding was great.

192
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,700
But that's not real life.

193
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,326
I mean, I guess I got a happy ending,

194
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,328
but every happy ending has the day after

195
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,580
the happy ending, right?

196
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:37,789
And the day after that.

197
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,124
So the wedding was so much fun.

198
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,626
It was the happiest day of my life.

199
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,211
But, you know, what does that say

200
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,296
about all the days I have left?

201
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,506
Whoa.

202
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,843
We're such a Zoe.

203
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,721
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

204
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:53,805
Hold this.

205
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,682
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.

206
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,058
You're supposed to hold the jacket

207
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,643
so it doesn't go on the floor.

208
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,980
Hey, sorry, BoJack... I
mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

209
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:04,441
But I work for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

210
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:07,360
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Ugh.

211
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,987
I can't believe I'm on
a movie set, you know?

212
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,656
I mean, this is my first
chance to work on something big

213
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,325
since my rock opera fell apart.

214
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,788
Man, I really messed up
that huge career opportunity

215
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,956
all on my own, didn't I?

216
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,081
Uh...

217
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:25,462
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

218
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,546
Yep.

219
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,631
You said it.

220
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:30,174
Well, see you later.

221
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:32,427
[indistinct chatter]

222
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,887
Where can I grab a nosh?

223
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,931
Oh, craft services is in the kitchen.

224
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,016
Up the driveway, through
the living room, make a left.

225
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,059
- Can't miss it.
- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

226
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,562
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

227
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,815
Okay, fellas, here's the
thing about the story.

228
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,190
I don't buy it.

229
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,651
It's like something's missing,

230
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,277
but I can't put any of my fingers on it.

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,362
Um, maybe once we add the music...

232
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,572
The music? Are you kidding me?

233
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,865
Music? You're fired.

234
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,116
What dumb shit brought this dumb shit?

235
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay, you're fired too.

236
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,577
Oh, okay.

237
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,204
Anyone else got any bright ideas?

238
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

239
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,501
Hey, maybe it make it more Diane-y?

240
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,544
- Um, excuse me?
- I don't know.

241
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,755
This is probably stupid,
but the whole story's

242
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,049
about how this guy's in
love with this lady, right?

243
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:14,427
But we don't even know who
she is or what she wants.

244
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,888
I mean, maybe give her more lines or words

245
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,223
or, I don't know, feelings or whatever?

246
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:20,308
What?

247
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,310
He's new. He doesn't know the rules.

248
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,688
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

249
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,110
Yes. Yeah.

250
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:32,195
I love you.

251
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,279
Who is this kid?

252
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,614
You're a genius.

253
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:35,782
- I'm gonna kiss your face.
- What?

254
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,784
Oh! [Laughs]

255
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,202
Come back to my web.

256
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,620
Let's talk about Diane's feelings

257
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,080
and make this baby sing.

258
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,582
Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe,

259
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,584
specifically the top half of the wardrobe,

260
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,462
specifically the shirt part of
the top half of the wardrobe,

261
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:52,716
specifically the neck part of
the shirt part of the wardrobe.

262
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,759
[cell phone rings]

263
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,219
Ugh. What now?

264
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,013
I'm sick of this dog and pony show.

265
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,597
The movie is dumb.

266
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,349
Mr. Peanutbutter is
annoying the shit out of me,

267
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,976
and there's too much
honeydew in the fruit bowl.

268
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,644
Blech. Honeydew is garbage fruit.

269
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,855
Also, why is BoJack being
played by an old, nebbishy

270
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:07,939
five-foot-tall
bald guy?

271
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,357
Is that how the world sees me?

272
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,441
Oh, I see.

273
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,861
So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street,

274
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,864
but I'm not a deft-enough
talent to capture the essence

275
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,949
of the elusive BoJack Horseman.

276
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:22,037
So sorry to offend you, sir.

277
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,955
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon

278
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,916
so people will get an opportunity to see

279
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,458
the real BoJack Horseman.

280
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,086
Oh, are you coming out with a book?

281
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,378
You never mentioned it.

282
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,629
Plus, Todd's being super weird.

283
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:32,756
I think he's onto me.

284
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,882
Onto you in regards to what?

285
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,592
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

286
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:38,261
I sabotaged his rock opera
by getting him readdicted

287
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,304
to a video game because I
didn't want him to move out.

288
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,057
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

289
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,267
Anyway, I think he knows
and might be plotting

290
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,727
to sabotage me back.

291
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,604
Why is it that 90% of our conversations

292
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,814
these days revolve
around plotting sabotages?

293
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,524
Are you saying I should
plot a countersabotage?

294
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,401
No, no more plotting.

295
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,695
Just be a good soldier and do your job.

296

Have you seen the new draft?

299

They took it all off you and put it on me.

00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:03,286
What?

301
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,789
Apparently some dickweed named Todd

302
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,083
decided I should be three-dimensional

303
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,001
and you should have no lines.

304

Ugh. Isn't this town sick of creating

305

three-dimensional roles for women?

This happens to me all the time!

307

A.O. Scott is sick of talking
about how brilliant I am.

Todd.

309
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,264
I guess what I've been saying

310
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,267
for the last seven
uninterrupted minutes is,

311
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,271
how can I forgive my father
if I can't forgive myself?

312
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,898
True dat.

313
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,234
But none of that matters,
because we bring out

314
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,987
the best in each other.

315
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,658
I'm the chocolate, and
you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,827
- True dat.
- Mwah!

317

Cut! Amazing.

318

This is the movie that I wanted to make.

This is gonna be great.

the movie's all about Diane,

323
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,176
I really need to dig deep
and get to know the real you.

324
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:02,804
So let's talk and talk
and talk until I am you

325
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,764
and you are nothing
but a hollowed-out husk

326
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,391
of your former self and every
thought and every feeling

327
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:11,270
you ever had belongs to me and me alone.

328
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:15,108
So do we like Sprite, or
are we more of a 7-Up girl?

329
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,777
Uh, that all sounds great.

330
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,363
But, you know, the person you
should really be talking to

331
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,115
is that guy.

332
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,367
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- Diane loves talking to him.

333
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,952
They have great rapport.

334
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,580
In fact, Diane could spend
all day talking to him

335
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,167
and never talk to me again.

336
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,629
Oh, I get it, because
Diane doesn't talk to Diane.

337
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,757
- Diane talks to...
- Anybody else.

338
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,342
Hey, Todd, remember that time

339
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,969
when you wouldn't clean up your shit?

340
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,428
That was hilarious.

341
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,430
- We've had some good times.
- Oh. Hi.

342
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,266
So I was thinking, I have some...

343
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,228
[sighs] pretty sloppy seconds
left over from P.F. Chang's

344
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,521
in the fridge, and I don't
think that I want it anymore.

345
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:54,856
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

346
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,482
Friendly gesture because we're friends.

347
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,526
- Uh... - Oh-oh,
there's my guy.

348
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,778
I heard you had a few more
thoughts about the script.

349
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:01,863
I do.

350
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,615
I was just thinking, what if
we made the BoJack character

351
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,659
into a real shithead?

352
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,870
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't think it's necessary.

353
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:12,582
Yeah, let's... Let's make
him be a real selfish asshole

354
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,834
so the audience has
someone to root against.

355
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,211
You're probably right.

356
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:17,503
Let's take another swing at the script

357
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,047
and give BoJack more to do.

358
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
Now, when you say, "Give
BoJack more to do"...

359
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:22,133
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

360
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,094
And also, now that I'm thinking about it,

361
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:27,889
why does the movie have
to take place on Earth?

362
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,600
You are blowing my head.

363
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,476
- I hope you like Oscars.
- Honeydew?

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,604
More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

365
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,522
Yes, I do." Right?

366
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,608
Not right, and I would love to
go through all the reasons why,

367
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:40,151
but I've got bigger concerns right now.

368
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,361
- Honeydew, go on.
- Did you notice

369
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,155
that the Mr. Peanutbutter
part has been cut in half?

370
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,866
- What is happening to our movie?
- I thought you hated the movie.

371
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,826
Yeah, I do, but if I'm
gonna be in a dumb movie

372
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,245
I hate that makes no sense,

373
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,996
I should at least be the star of it.

374
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,458
Look, I agree that this
movie has really lost its way.

375
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,877
I mean, first of all,
why would Mr. Peanutbutter

376
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,712
wear a crew neck T-shirt?

377
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:02,381
And second of all, uh...

378
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:03,841
It's just the shirt, isn't it?

379
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,093
It doesn't make sense.

380
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,427
I'm a V-neck man.

381
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,221
A V you can put your sunglasses in.

382
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,764
Can you do that with a crew neck?

383
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,599
Because I'd like to see you tr...

384
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,476
Whoa.

385
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,229

Bagel.

387
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,358
Thanks so much for
running this scene with me.

388
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,443
I have so many lines to learn.

389
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,862
Yeah, well, most of my
lines are, "True dat,"

390
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,948
but I guess it never hurts to practice.

391
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:30,076
The citizens of Planet
D want their king back.

392
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,787
But I'm more concerned with
getting my self-esteem back

393
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,040
after being in the shadow
of powerful men for so long.

394
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,208
True dat.

395
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,542
Is it just me, or is this movie

396
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,211
kind of flying off the rails?

397
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,213
Well, I don't want to
overuse my catchphrase here,

398
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,673
but true dat.

399
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,383
This is so typical.

400
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,802
I just wanted to do something light and fun

401
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:52,473
to distract me from the deep
well of sadness that is my life.

402
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,309
You probably wouldn't understand.

403
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,768
Oh, puh-lease.

404
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,645
I'm so deep down a well of sadness

405
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,773
that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn."

406
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,484
Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof.

407
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,861
What?

408
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,905
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

409
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,615
Pop this in a drawer.

410
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,576
Huh?

411
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,330
- [glass shatters]
- This is good, baby.

412
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,873
Oh, this is amazing.

413
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:18,916
Naomi, I haven't felt like this since...

414
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,084
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

415
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,295
Call me Diane.

416
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:25,882
Okay, got my bagel.

417
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,466
Now back to work.

418
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,344
Hey, guys.

419
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,845
Hey, guys!

420
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,515
Wow, wow.

421
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,394
So you guys really hit it off, huh?

422
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:38,895
That's awesome.

423
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,397
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom

424
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,480
before we go down to set?

425
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:42,857
You read my mind.

426
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,444
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

427
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,363
Hey, so I finished the book

428
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,198
and sent the draft to the publishers.

429
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,282
What? My book is ready?

430
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,367
Let me read it. Can I read it?

431
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,411
Call Pinky.

432
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,371
He'll probably send you a copy
as soon as he's done with it.

433
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:57,997
All right! You hang tight, baby.

434
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,623
I got an instant classic to read.

435
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:00,708
Keep the engine running, though,

436
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,252
because if I know me,
this book is gonna give me

437
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,544
a pretty big erection.

438
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,380
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.

439
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,090
You'll love it. It's a work in progress.

Hello. Penguin Publishing.

May I interest you in our bento lunch box?

Pinky, it's me.

446
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,143
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.

00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,020
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you,

448
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,607
it's not quite what we
expected, but it is good.

449
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,359
I'm telling you, this could really sell.

450
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,985
I might actually get to see my kids again.

451
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,070
Great. Send it over.

452
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:30,529
I'll read it right now.

453
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,282
All right, I sent it, but just remember...

454
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,867
To set my expectations sky-high?

455
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,327
- Way ahead of you.
- [cell phone beeps]

All right, book, let's see what you got.

"The first time I met BoJack Horseman,

he was puking cotton candy off the deck

461
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,756
of his lavish house in the Hills,

462
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,716
the lights of the city twinkling below us.

The Make-A-Wish kids

the time the great BoJack Horseman

referred to their parents as
'a bunch of used jizz bags.'

He filled the air with

to take the steps required to fix them.

Got out of the car, stepped
out toward the coast,

and looked across the water,

It's a phone. Well, a

You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir,

478

but instead you wrote a
story about how you spent

479
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,048
six months with me and saw
what a big, dumb loser I am.

00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,553
to fully capture you, warts and all...

482
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,472
This isn't warts and all. It's just warts.

483
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:38,515
Where's the all?

484
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,183
I come off like a total asshole.

485
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,060
You come off as complex and deeply troubled

486
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,479
but ultimately sympathetic.

487
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,356
You might be too close to see that.

488
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,899
There's an entire chapter
about me eating apple fritters.

489
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,568
You did go through that fritter phase.

490
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,986
Is this book how you see me?

491
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,446
That day we ran errands together,

492
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,780
I thought that we had a really good time,

493
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,366
but you just wrote about how I cried

494
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,117
because the dry cleaner
took my head shot down.

495
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,618
You were very emotional.

496
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,454
They didn't even replace me with anyone.

497
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,622
Now it's just a faded spot
where my face used to be.

498
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,624
This will actually do
wonders for your career.

499
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,043
Trust me.

500
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,003
I mean, you're just a dumb actor

501
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,629
who doesn't know anything
about books, right?

502
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:12,549
- [laughs]
- What?

503
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,841
Remember? From before?

504
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,301
Oh, I don't think you understand

505
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,386
what's happening here.

506
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,762
This is not a casual
conversation between friends.

507
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,391
This is your boss telling his employee

508
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,933
that she did a bad job.

509
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:24,977
- Try again.
- What?

510
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,937
Start over, but do it right this time.

511
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,440
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

512
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,776
- Ugh!
- [cell phone dialing]

513
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,488
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Diane?

514
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,574
Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed?

515
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:38,866
Um, yes.

516
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,368
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you

517
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,080
a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys

518
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:47,291
or whatever the hell you
measure your journalism with.

519
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,959
Curses!

520
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:51,879
My evil plan has been
defeated, but I'll be back.

521
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,297
You haven't heard the last

522
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:56,593
of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

523
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:57,718
Oh, no!

524
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,303
You shot a laser at me!

525
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,222
Oh, no! I'm dying.

526
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,641
Oh, no, I'm dead.

527
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,602
And so now that we've escaped

528
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,020
the evil clutches of the emperor,

529
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,773
I'm free to assume my natural form,

530
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,359
an all-knowing floating orb of light?

531
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,485
True dat.

532
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,112
- Cut, cut.
- [buzzer sounds]

533
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,530
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.

534
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,449
Is this even a movie anymore?

535
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,452
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

536
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,079
Yeah, maybe it's an
immersive smartphone app

537
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:29,917
or a 21st-century approach to
360-degree media envelopment.

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,879
Yeah, or maybe it's just,
like, a feeling, you know?

539
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,673
- We've got work to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

540
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,092
- Oh, my God, this is so good.
- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

541
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,385
Yes! Go, Todd.

542
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,803
Hello?

543
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,179
Are you just gonna leave me like this?

544
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,264
Anyone?

545
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,308
Ah!

546
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:46,767
Oh, good. You're here.

547
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,227
Oh, hi, BoJack.

548
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,853
This whole day's been a shit show.

549
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:51,689
The book turned out to
be a total hatchet job.

550
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:53,190
The movie's a disaster.

551
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,693
But thank God I have one
good thing in my life,

552
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,819
and that's you.

553
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,279
BoJack, I...

554
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,323
Please let me say this
before I lose my nerve.

555
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,450
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside

556
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,077
as a wild stallion, but
I am tired of the rodeo,

557
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,663
and I'm finally ready to saddle up.

558
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:07,746
BoJack...

559
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,290
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

560
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,584
this mustang wants to rest
his head in the comforts

561
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,043
of your spacious barn.

562
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:14,337
Uh, what?

563
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,963
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

564
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,298
BoJack, they fired me

565
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:19,967
and replaced me with a ball on a stick.

566
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,051
I'm so sorry.

567
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,679
But look at the bright side.

568
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:24,888
Now you and I can just hang
out and talk about feelings.

569
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,558
No, but you're not getting
it. Boys never get it.

570
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,436
BoJack, I was in character as Diane,

571
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,648
and as Diane, we had a real connection.

572
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,275
But now that I'm off the
movie, I'm Naomi again,

573
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,903
and Naomi is not interested
in BoJack Horseman.

574
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,532
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.

575
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,950
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts?

576
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,035
No.

577
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,620
You fell in love with Diane.

578
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,122
Naomi what?

579
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,832
Good-bye, BoJack.

580
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:52,916
Ugh.

581
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,419
See? Nothing.

582
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,341
What's going on? Why are they packing up?

583
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,510
Oh, glad you're here. This is exciting.

584
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,428
Since we last talked,
this film has gone through

585
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,430
- so many permutations.
- So many.

586
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,140
First, we reimagined the whole film

587
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,727
as an interactive social-media experience.

588
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,311
Those are the dumbest
words I've ever heard.

589
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:13,396
I know.

590
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,314
So we realized it was actually

591
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,066
more of a floating art installation,

592
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,735
but that didn't feel right either.

593
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:20,361
We thought, is it a high-end perfume?

594
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:22,279
A series of interrelated fortune cookies?

595
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:25,282
A hat that if you turn it
upside down, it's a boat?

596
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,785
- No, it's none of those things.
- Exactly.

597
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,912
That's why we finally settled on this.

598
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:30,996
Voilà!

599
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,498
What am I looking at?

600
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,752
[Todd] It is a bimonthly
curated box of snacks.

601
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:36,960
I don't know what that means.

602
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,546
I know. It's confusing.

603
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,297
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month,

604
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,800
the bimonthly that means every other month,

605
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:45,678
and each time it's a
different box of snacks.

606
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,971
This is the future of cinema.

607
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:52,059
You guys, finally, my story has been told.

608
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,937
Okay, that's a wrap,
everyone. [claps hands]

609
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,940
Thanks for making this
box of snacks a reality.

610
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,024
Let's go home.

611
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,738
What the hell happened to the movie?

612
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:07,283
Shit, there were snacks
here the whole time?

613
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:08,409
Not bad.

614
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,035
- Whoa!
- Look, I get it.

615
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,704
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback

616
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,623
as revenge for what I
did to your rock opera.

617
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:17,293
Revenge? Oh, that would
have been such a good idea.

618
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:18,586
Damn it, Todd!

619
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,546
Look, I figured out what you did,

620
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,257
but I've been trying to put
it behind me and do my job.

621
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,218
So cutting my part down
was not about revenge?

622
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:27,344
No.

623
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,221
And making BoJack the villain of your movie

624
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,890
was not a coded statement
of your feelings about me?

625
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:32,975
No.

626
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,769
Oh, okay, great.

627
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,062
Well, I'm... I'm glad we buried the hatchet

628
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,147
and everything's cool.

629
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,818
Uh, actually, you know,
everything is not cool.

630
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,361
You ruined my rock opera
by using character actress

631
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:45,904
Margo Martindale to trick me

632
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:47,615
into playing an addictive video game.

633
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,533
And saying it all together like that,

634
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,201
it all sounds kind of ludicrous.

635
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,037
But still, it was something I cared about,

636
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,540
and what you did really hurt me.

637
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,793
Oh. Well, this feels shitty.

638
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,462
You sure you don't want to just
get some revenge real quick...

639
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,547
thump me once in the stones
and then we'll be even?

640
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,923
I got to go.

641
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:09,094
I've got some artisanal popcorns
to gauge the mouthfeel of.

642
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:10,847
- Hey, BoJack.
- Yeah?

643
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,181
You want an apple fritter?

644
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:13,850
Uh, sure.

645
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:15,518
- Yeah, I bet you would.
- [laughter]

646
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,102
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.

647
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,104
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.

648
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:21,565
Why? What... What... What's happening here?

649
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:24,151
"Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book"?

650
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:25,695
No. No!

651
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:28,405
Um, everyone, please
turn off your Internet.

652
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,866
It has gone bad.

653
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:32,618
I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.

654
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,620
- What a loser.
- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

655
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,205
Give me your phones. I'm a celebrity.

656
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:37,498
You have to listen to me.

657
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,291
Look at his deep well of sadness.

658
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,251
It's hilarious.

659
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:43,587
Don't look at me. I'm well-adjusted.

660
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,882
- You all want my life.
- [laughter]

661
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:47,424
Uh, what the hell?

662
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,134
I know, I know. But if
you just listen for...

663
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,720
You posted your dumb
little book on the Internet.

664
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,638
No, I just leaked the
first couple chapters,

665
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,348
and people are already talking about it.

666
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,518
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are?

667
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,478
I know you're mad, and
you have every right to be,

668
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,104
but you got to read some of these comments.

669
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,565
People love you.

670
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:03,816
And they're gonna love you even more

671
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,776
when they read the rest of my book.

672
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,570
- Your book?
- Our book.

673
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,321
Nobody is gonna read that book.

674
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,573
How do you still not get that?

675
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:12,742
It is never going to be published.

676
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:15,118
BoJack, I stand by my work.

677
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,954
This is a really good book.

678
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:20,290
And if you just give it time, you'll see.

679
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:22,084
[sighs]

680
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,460
Maybe you're right.

681
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:24,754
Really?

682
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,589
No. You're fired.
