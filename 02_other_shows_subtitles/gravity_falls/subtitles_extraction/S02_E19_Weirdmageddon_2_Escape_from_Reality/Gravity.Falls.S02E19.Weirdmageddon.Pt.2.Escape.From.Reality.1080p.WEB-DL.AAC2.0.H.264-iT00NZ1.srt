Only way to salvation

Oh, sorry.
Touchy subject.

Anyways, it's been fun
turning Gravity Falls

Do you hear
'80s music?

00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,964

- It's complicated.
- What are you saying?

119
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,646
I'm saying this is

122
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,358
- You did what?!
- Look, after you said

123
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,660
you wouldn't come back home with
me at the end of the summer

124
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,228
for your "apprenticeship,"

125
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,664
I wanted to hide
in my sweater forever.

126
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,833
But then I woke up
in a place that gives me

127
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,701
exactly what I wanted--

128
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,137
an endless summer where
we'll never have to grow up.

00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,705
Ahem!

144
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm sorry. I can't

This world always

sometimes even
before you do.

149
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,852
Apparently I wanted
a chinchilla.

Right again, Mabeland.

151
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,756
Mabel, listen to yourself.
This is crazy.

152
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,291
I'm sorry about our fight,

153
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,560
and I'm sorry
things aren't great right now,

154
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,363
but that doesn't mean
you can just stay
in here forever.

155
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,132
Hey, take a chill pill.
Those grow on trees here.

156
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,367
You stay out of this,

157
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,102
Dude, calm down.

158
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,703
Dippy Fresh didn't do
anything to you, dawg.

159

162
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,911
Mabeland knows
just what you want,

163
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,446
and always provides.

164
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,484
Pudding center.
Nice.

165
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,719
Actually, Mabel,
I'm with Dipper on this.

166
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,589
Gravity Falls
is in trouble,
and I really think--

167
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,291
( horn honking )

168
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,762
ALL: Wendy!

169
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,764
Guys? You're safe.

170
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,300
We've got a monster truck
full of fireworks, fake ID's,

171
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,168
and pranking supplies.

172
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,070
Wanna drive this truck
to the high school

173
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,105
and glue this plunger
to the principal's head?

174
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,808
Yes. Yes, I do.

175
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,610
Sorry, guys. I've always
wanted to do that.

176
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,645
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

177
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,782
ALL: Whoo-hoo!

178
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,450
- Wendy?
- Don't worry, dude.

179
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,619
There's nothing in this world
that could break me

180
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,788
from our mission.

181
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,958
Soos <i>mi hijo.</i>
<i>I have returned.</i>

182
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,660
Holy... whoa, whoa.
Dad?

183
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,162
You don't remember
what I look like,

184
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,964
so I have the body
of a pro wrestler,

185
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,366
and a face you once saw
on a hot sauce bottle.

186
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,202
I was never there for you,
but in this world, I can be.

187
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,204
- You're perfect.
- It's a trap.

188
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,974
Don't go with him, Soos,
no matter what he offers you.

189
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,942
Want to play catch?

190
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,477
I'm sorry, dude.

191
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,379
Even if it is
all a dream,

192
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,981
I've gotta play
just one game.

193
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,849
Come on, Dad.

194
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,851
Okay, this has
gone too far.

195
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,687
You can't honestly think
these fantasies are good
for anyone.

196
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,689
You can't argue with
the results.

197
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,291
People are happy here.

198
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,827
Does it really matter
if it's real or not?

199
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,229
For once, stop listening
to your head,

200
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,365
and listen to your heart.

201
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,468
Mabeland has something
for everyone, even you.

202
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,470
In fact...

203
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,807
Nope. Not looking.
Not looking.

204
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,080
( all groaning )

205
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,683
All right, can anybody
explain to me why,

206
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,819
even with our newfound
infinite power...

207
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,157
none of us can escape
the borders

208
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,360
of this stupid
hick town?!

209
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,829
There's some kind of
force field keeping us in.

210
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,399
But who would know
how to fix it?

211
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:32,537
Hmm. Maybe someone needs
to come out of retirement.

212
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,039
Bill. Sorry, boss,

213
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,875
but Gideon let
the Pines family escape.

214
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,743
They're inside Mabel's
bubble as we speak.

215
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,279
( evil laughter )

216
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,548
Mabel's bubble is
the most diabolical trap

217
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,250
I've ever created.

218
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,918
It would take
a will of titanium

219
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
not to give into
its temptations.

220
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,423
Fetch me Gideon, and take
the rest of the day off.

221
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,992
Things just got
a little more interesting.

222
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,431
♪ Bo-ba-do-do,
I'm a stuffed animal tree ♪

223
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,300
♪ He's a stuffed
animal tree ♪

224
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,072
( all giggling )

225
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,808
Even my stone skips
are perfect.

226
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,743
Who am I kidding?

227
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,912
Maybe Mabel's right.

228
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,747
It's a horror show
out there.

229
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,916
At least the air here
is breathable.

230
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,718
Dude, you're talking
to a river.

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,920
Oh, hey, Wendy.
What's up?

232
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,456
I thought you were busy
wrecking the school
or whatever.

233
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Yeah, that got
old quick.

234
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,059
And this music
is really starting
to get on my nerves.

235
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,662
I think that stuff
you said about
this place is right.

236
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,498
Really? Well, now
we just need a plan.

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,734
Don't worry. You always
think of something.

238
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,736
( giggling )

239
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,842
You know, you're so much
smarter than, like,
everyone else.

240
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,910
( chuckles )
It's kinda funny.

241
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,647
If you were older,
you'd be, like,
my dream guy.

242
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,849
Wait. Do you
really mean that?

243
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,317
Wait a minute.

244
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,619
In this place, you can be
any age you want.

245
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,455
If we were the same age,
maybe you and me could...

246
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,524
I don't know...
actually be together.

247
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,926
Wait. Really?

248
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,062
I bet if we asked Mabel,
she could do it right now.

249
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,865
In this place,
it could finally be
just you and me.

250
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,135
Come on, man.
Just take my hand.

251
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:13,038
Wait. ( screams )
This isn't real!

252
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,208
( shrieks )

253
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,782
You shouldn't have
done that, Dipper!

254
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,817
We're watching you.

255
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,687
TOYS: There are
eyes everywhere.

256
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,321
- Hi, Dipper.
- Hey, Dipper.

257
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,956
- Hey, Dipper.
- Hey, Dipper.

258

Oh, my gosh.

260
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,363
This is crazy.

261
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,331
I'm losing my mind.

262
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,966
We have to get
out of here.

263
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,803
We have to go back...
to the real world!

( voice echoing )

265
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,175
Hey!

266
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,977
Under Article Smiley Face
of Exhibit Squeaky Duck,

267
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,480
you are hereby accused of
breaking our one rule--

268
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,515
mentioning reality.

269
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,150
( all exclaiming )

270
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:04,022
Prepare to be banished
from this land forever!

271
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,157
Mabel, you're
smarter than this.

272
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,760
Bill has you hypnotized
or something.

273
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,428
Are you really gonna
let them banish me?

274
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,030
No. Of course not.

275
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,598
That's my brother, guys.

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,567
There's gotta be
another way.

277
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,368
Very well.

278
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,404
If Dipper wishes to stay,
he must plead his case

279
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:24,142
in the ultimate trial
of   <i>Fantasy vs. Reality.</i>

280
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,079
Hey. Seriously?

281
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,082
( muffled chewing )
It was him.

282
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,026
Oh!

283
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,095
( quacking )

284
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,697
Seriously, Mabel?

285
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,133
You're letting them
take our argument to court?

286
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,135
Hey, I didn't make
the rules of Mabeland.

287
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,938
Yes, you did.
There's a tapestry
of you making the rules.

288
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,042
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Kitty Kitty Meow
Meow Face Schwartzstein.

289
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,213
- Order, order.
- ( gavel squeaking )

290
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,016
This trial begins
right meow.

291
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,087
Oh! Ha ha!

292
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,188
Ahem. Judge?

293
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,291
Sorry, sorry.
( clears throat )

294
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,460
We are here to try
Dipper Pines

295
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,131
in the case of
<i>Fantasy vs. Reality.</i>

296
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,267
If Dipper wins,
Mabel will return with him

297
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,902
to the real world.

298
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,071
But if he loses,
he will be banished forever,

299
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,274
and replaced with
town darling Dippy Fresh.

300
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,276
Dippy, come on out.

301
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,945
Flip-a-dip-dip.

302
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,248
I hate him so much.

303
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,616
The final decision
will be made by

304
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,251
a jury of your peers.

305
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,156
Hi there.
I love your headband.

306
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,492
Shut your mouth.
I love your headband.

307
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,494
We're all wearing
the same headband.

308
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,329
ALL: Ha ha!
Headband!

309
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,032
Look, Mabel,
this whole thing
is ridiculous.

310
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,301
But if winning a trial
is what it takes to get you
to come home with us,

311
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,670
then so be it.

312
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,473
I'm sorry, Dipper, but
I can only speak through
my legal team now.

313
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,310
We have a doctorate degree
in hunkiness.

314
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,178
Also criminal
and international law.

315
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,314
Let's hear
opening statements.

316
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,882
Your Honor,
townsfolk,

317
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,483
lovely ladies
of the jury.

318
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,352
Oh, he's talking
about us.

319
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,187
That's lovely.

320
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,189
My case is simple.

321
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,125
This very unrighteous
dude thinks that reality
is better than fantasy.

322
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,330
But reality is bogus,
lame, and whack.

323
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,532
Objection, Your Honor.
That's conjecture.

324
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,000
Meow-verruled!

325
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,135
I'd like to show you
this "reality"

326
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,004
that Dipper loves so much.

327
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,306
Show you how it has
wronged my client, and Dipper,

328
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,175
their entire lives.

329
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,676
Exhibit "A."

330
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,346
Mabel's scrapbook.

331
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,315
Second grade,
October 10.

332
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,318
Photo day.

333
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,222
( sniffling )
Darn allergies.

334
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,025
Boom! A million
slap bracelets.

335
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,194
I'm gonna have
the best photo ever.

336
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,597
And how do you like
my new pigtails?

337
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,532
Have fun, brat.

338
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,335
( gasps )
You ruined my hair!

339
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,404
Dipper, what do I do?

340
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,040
Um, I... well...
I don't...

341
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,075
- ( sobbing )
- Mabel!

342
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,282
Mabel's fantasy was
having a great school photo,

343
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,251
but reality
had other plans.

344
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,020
Look, that was
one bad day.

345
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,089
One of many.
February 14,
fourth grade.

346
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,326
- Valentine's Day.
- Oh, come on, man.
You can't...

347
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,463
How many Valentines
did you get, Dipper?

348
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,568
Oh, hey,
Dipper didn't get any.

349
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,804
Oh, man, I thought
I was the class loser.

350
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,639
Hey, everyone,
Dipstick didn't get any.

351
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:45,176
( laughter )

352
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,181
I can't believe
that kid's your brother.

353
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,153
Hey, what's the point
of all this?

354
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,421
That was in the past.

355
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,656
Is your life
any better now, bro?

356
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,660
Heartbreak, disaster,
broken promises.

357
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,362
That's reality for you.

358
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,664
Out there,
it's nothing but heartbreak.

359
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,167
But in here,
who wants pug sundaes?

360
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,906
Hand me a microphone,
Xyler.

361
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,276
Totally
righteous, bro.

362
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,011
- Are we brothers?
- I don't know.

363
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,447
I think we're ready
for a verdict.

364
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,615
Wait! I haven't even
presented my case.

365
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,718
Do you even
have a case?

366
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,288
Yes, I do,
Your Honor.

367
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,624
I call as a witness
Mabel Pines.

368
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,859
( all gasping )

369
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,661
Uh, objection?

370
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,296
I'll allow it.

371
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,298
Us cats are famously
curious, meow meow.

372
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,733
( spectators murmuring )

373
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,304
Mabel, listen.

374
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,806
I might not have
all the answers.

375
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,943
I'm not stylish,
and I'm not cool,

376
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,278
and I can't make
pugs appear out of thin air.

377
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,614
- Boo!
- Guilty!

378
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,283
But I know one thing well,
and that's you,

379
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,886
and I know that even though
you might act like it,

380
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,322
you don't wanna be
in this fantasy world.

381
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,991
Uh... pssshh!
Yeah, right.

382
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,160
You're scared
of growing up.

383
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,828
And who could
blame you?

384
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,530
I'm scared, too.

385
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,366
Uh... la la la la la la la!
I'm not listening.

386
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,803
Guards, the fingers.

387
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,371
Look, real life
stinks sometimes, okay?

388
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,373
I'm not gonna lie.

389
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,575
There's a better way
to get through it than denial,

390
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,211
and that's with help from
people who care about you.

391
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,213
It's how we've gotten
through our whole lives.

392
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,215
Just look.

393
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,018
Mabel, I figured out a way
to fix your photo.

394
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,920
What? You have a wig?

395
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,156
No, but I have a razor.

396
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,326
( laughs )
You're crazy.

397
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,579
We've always been there
for each other.

398
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,686
Mabel, I thought you were
living a fantasy,

399
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,088
but look at me.

400
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,789
I actually thought I was
gonna stay here

401
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,558
and be Ford's apprentice.

402
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,893
Spend my entire teens
cooped up in a basement

403
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,129
with a lab coat.
How ridiculous is that?

404
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,466
I don't know what's
gonna happen in the future,

405
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,634
but whatever it is,
you don't have to fear,

406
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,436
because we'll
do it together.

407
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,039
I'm not taking
Ford's apprenticeship.

408
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,374
We've traveled
to heck and back to get you,

409
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,243
and we're going back
together.

410
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,611
Leave this fantasy world.

411
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,314
Let's beat Bill
and grow up together.

412
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,252
Order. Order in the court!

413
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,621
Dang it, why is this hammer
squeaking?!

414
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,223
You mean it?

415
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,624
You're really
coming home with me?

416
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,159
Yes. Definitely.

417
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,161
Absolutely.

418
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,762
Awkward sibling hug?

419
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,066
- ( frightened exclamations )
- Don't do it!

420
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,968
You do this,
and it's all over.

421
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,471
Sincere sibling hug.

422
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,074
Don't do the pats!

423
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,376
Pat, pat.

424
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,519
Oh, man.

425
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,421
I never noticed
how bright this place is.

426
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,124
Ugh! Have I actually been
listening to the same song

427
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,860
- for an entire week?
- ( anguished yowl )

428
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,929
Whoa, time to calm you down.

429
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,767
Uh, why isn't
this working?

430
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,570
Because your reign over
this land is over!

431
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,844
We gotta get outta here.

432
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,280
Soos, Wendy,
Paradise is cancelled.

433
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,523
Everyone get on.

434
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,631
Take us to freedom,
Giant Waddles. Yeah!

435
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,339
All right, guys,
are you ready for this?

436
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,807
Sorry, Mabeland.

437
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,144
It's time to burst
your bubble.

438
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,550
Whoa.

439
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,552
You all good?
Everyone good?

440
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,255
- ( all laughing )
- We've missed you, Mabel.

441
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,658
Hey, Dipper, I appreciate
what you said back there.

442
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,827
But if you wanna take
Ford's apprenticeship,

443
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,529
I won't get
in your way.

444
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,664
Pfft. Miss out on
your awkward teen years?

445
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,399
You wish.

446
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,437
Man, I went nuts
back there.

447
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,673
I mean, come on,
the real world can't
be that bad, right?

448
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,411
Oh, boy.

449
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,415
Where is everyone?
The town's deserted.

450
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,618
Did Bill already win?

451
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,487
Come on, guys.
Let's see if we can
go hide out in the shack.

452
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,726
Yes! It's in shambles
just like we left it.

453
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,729
Oh, man, this is
the first time I've
ever felt happy going to work.

454
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,597
Hello, house.
Hello, porch.

455
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,433
Hello, wads of gum
I left stuck to the couch.

456
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,302
( muffled noises )

457
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,304
Wait. What was that?

458
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,339
Sh!

459
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,613
Let's get 'em, dudes.

460
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,649
ALL: Yah!!

461
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,951
( screaming )

462
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,487
- Stan?
- Kids?

463
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,289
( toilet flushes )

464
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,392
Just so everyone knows,
we're out of toilet paper.

465
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,061
Did I miss something?

466
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,033
Whoa, we survived.

467
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,636
But where are we?

468
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,407
Are we real?

469
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,975
Is this reality?

470
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,110
Jean-Paul Sartre
postulated that

471
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,413
every existing thing
is born without reason,

472
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,481
prolongs itself
out of weakness,

473
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,949
and dies by chance.

474
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,085
Totally righteous,
bro.

475
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,054
I know!
