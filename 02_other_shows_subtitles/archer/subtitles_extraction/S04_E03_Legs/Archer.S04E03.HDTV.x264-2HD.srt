And are we done here?

00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:39,237

Not for the Morelli thing!

I planned that entire operation!

MALORY: Yes, and you did excellent legwork...
ARCHER: But now it requires

35
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:54,820
literal legwork, Ray, like
walking, and maybe running.

36

because I'll be in brand-new shoes.

if you'd like to walk again.

impulses to your muscles and ligaments and

stuff, which I will fuse to a
vanadium alloy endoskeleton,

back where it's supposed to go...

I take tons of pictures with my phone.

Because you could die.

GILLETTE: I realize that.

138
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:04,525

KRIEGER: Oh, that's not

necessary.

forbid, the worst happens...

Oh, and when I'm through
talking to Malory?

ARCHER: Then why are
you dressed like that?

Yo, Magnum P.U.

units of plasma, some bolt cutters,

C'mon, walk and talk.

exact second I'd be dead right now!

grandfather's, you ass!

we're the Warren Commission.

It's a real magic bullet!

at Krieger's door in the first place?

ARCHER: Oh shit, right!

Brett, this might be some kind of record!

227

a terminator of gays?

weird, but he's not homophobic,

well, no, aren't terminators asexual?

00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,680
For the ambulance to take your
grievously wounded child to the

310
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:41,115
hospital for emergency surgery?

311
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:45,786
MALORY: Yes, Woodhouse, and then you
can go buy some wax for your cross.

312
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,188
LANA: Krieger?

313
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:49,257
KRIEGER: Oh my God... I'm
a little busy right now!

314
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:52,927
LANA: Yeah I know, are you cyborging Ray?

315
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:53,994
KRIEGER: No?

316
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,764
LANA: Look, I think it's great if you are --
KRIEGER: Then yes!

317
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,166
LANA: But I think Archer's
gonna try to stop you!

318
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,135
He's kinda freaking out!

319
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:01,884
KRIEGER: Let him!

320
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,938
That door came off the Graf Spee!

321
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:08,142
To get in here he'd need --
RODNEY: One RPG-7 launcher and two grenades.

322
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,745
As per the note from your mother.

323
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,147
ARCHER: Thank you, uh, sorry,
what was your name again?

324
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:13,848
RODNEY: Rodney.

325
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,317
ARCHER: Thank you, asshole.

326
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,023
MALORY: What in the...?

327
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,693
Why aren't you people on
the way to the airport?

328
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,230
LANA: We may have sort
of a, uh, situation.

329
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,031
MALORY: And what sort would that be?!

330
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,167
RON: This is what I'm talking about...
MALORY: Ron!

331
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,837
If you keep it up, this headache
you gave me is going to last for

332
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:34,972
the next three to five nights.

333
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,679
LANA: Look, don't worry, I can handle it.

334
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,222
MALORY: But --
RON: Let her handle it!

335
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,510
She seems capable.

336
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,845
LANA: Hey, thanks.

337
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,581
RON: Reminds me of the head mechanic
at my dealership in Yonkers.

338
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:44,648
He's a black.

339
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,349
LANA: Wow.

340
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,251
RON: I know, and head mechanic!

341
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:50,388
Now c'mon, babe, let these people do
whatever it is you pay them to do,

342
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,222
and let's go start our weekend.

343
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,058
MALORY: Alright, but
don't miss that flight.

344
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,228
God knows how long it takes to
check in with a rocket launcher.

345
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,765
LANA: Oh, shit!

346
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:04,402
CYRIL: Well calling the
airport's not gonna help.

347
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,739
ARCHER: Oh, and one last thing, Rodney,
when I get back from Rome, you're --

348
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,841
RODNEY: Hang on oooooone second.

349
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:11,409
Armory.

350
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,243
CHERYL/CAROL: Hey will
you bring me a present?

351
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,278
ARCHER: No.

352
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:15,446
RODNEY: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

353
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,080
Ooookay.

354
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,015
You were saying?

355
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,249
ARCHER: I... shit.

356
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,586
Something about an asskicking
with handmade Italian shoes?

357
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,390
RODNEY: Well, think about
it, you've got time.

358
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,892
ARCHER: What do you think you're doing?

359
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,259
RODNEY: What do you think you're doing?!

360
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,064
Obtaining armory materiel under false
pretenses is a fireable offense!

361
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:38,469
ARCHER: Oh my -- I basically just lurch
from one fireable offense to the next!

362
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,971
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh, like the
infamous "Luau Incident."

363
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,308
ARCHER: Jesus Christ, how many times
do I have to apologize for that?!

364
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,510
CHERYL/CAROL: Once would be nice!

365
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:47,578
ARCHER: No.

366
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:48,913
Rodney open this door.

367
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,113
RODNEY: Give me that weapon.

368
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:50,514
ARCHER: Oh.

369
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:51,582
You mean this rocket launcher?

370
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,384
Because I bet it would open the door.

371
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,286
RODNEY: No, that is
inadvisable at this time.

372
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,955
ARCHER: Ya know, if I asked it nicely.

373
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,289
RODNEY: I seriously wouldn't do that.

374
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,093
ARCHER: Yeah, because you're not awesome.

375
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,028
MALORY: Oh, and what
fresh hell is this?!

376
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,297
RON: Whatever it is, they can handle it!

377
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,467
MALORY: They can't even
handle a simple luau!

378
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:14,271
My God, what they did to that pig...Brett?!
BRETT: Heeelp...

379
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,942
BRETT: Nghhh...
MALORY: Great, now I get to slog

380
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,309
my new Delmans through a lake of blood.

381
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,312
I want that all cleaned
up before Monday, mister!

382
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,347
Do you hear me?!

383
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:27,317
RODNEY: No... Because
that room is blast-proof!

384
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,319
ARCHER: Mawp.

385
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,322
Maaaawp.

386
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,492
Mawp.

387
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,794
PAM: What the shit was that?!

388
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:40,297
KRIEGER: Hopefully the last remaining
shred of Archer's eardrums.

389
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,333
LANA: That crazy son of a -- come on!

390
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,637
CYRIL: Why is your instinctive
response to run toward explosions?!

391
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,773
LANA: Mmm... because
I'm not a giant pussy?

392
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,341
CYRIL: Although, somehow,
incredibly single.

393
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,142
LANA: Wh-?!

394
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,344
I go on... tons of dates!

395
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,345
CYRIL: With who?!

396
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,346
LANA: Men!

397
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,015
Men models!

398
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,850
Men who model!

399
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,519
[ High pitched whine ]

400
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,227
CHERYL/CAROL: -- permanent damage
to my earballs because you're too

401
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:09,226
chickenshit to take your candy-ass to
the future and smash the defense grid

402
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,029
so Skynet --
RODNEY: Whoa whoa whoa!

403
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,163
Not cool, man!

404
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,832
That is not at all cool!

405
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,368
CHERYL/CAROL: Rodney you
mind your own dicky beeswax!

406
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,870
You got another one in ya?

407
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,470
RODNEY: Ew.

408
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,305
ARCHER: I don't --
CHERYL/CAROL: Tease.

409
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,909
ARCHER: -- and I'm sorry for that one --
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't be.

410
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,377
ARCHER: -- because I'm just
gonna say it, I think it's

411
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,381
suuuper creepy you get sexually
aroused by physical violence.

412
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,385
CHERYL/CAROL: Well but
also emotional violence.

413
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,319
ARCHER: Wow.

414
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:36,921
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah.

415
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,722
ARCHER: That's even creepier.

416
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,824
So are you gonna open the damn door?

417
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,426
RODNEY: As soon as you
give me that weapon.

418
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:46,089
ARCHER: Wh-? Do you honestly wanna
live through the rise of the machines?!

419
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,908
Which you won't, because no one will?!

420
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,058
RODNEY: I --
ARCHER: It was rhetorical!

421
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,585
So now if you'll excuse me... I
have an entire human race to save.

422
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,854
RODNEY: What is he... hey
that's ISIS property!

423
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,656
ARCHER: What this?

424
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,156
RODNEY: Yes.

425
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,464
CHERYL/CAROL: Take me with you!

426
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,092
ARCHER: Shut up!

427
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,395
CHERYL/CAROL: Ooh, yeah, even
that little bit's enough to get

428
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,831
the engine revved up.

429
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,836
So Rodneeeeeey... Tease!

430
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,807
CYRIL: Jeezy Petes...
CHERYL/CAROL: Cyril what're you doing right now?

431
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,678
CYRIL: I --
LANA: Helping me find Archer, where is he?!

432
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,380
Super.

433
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,148
CYRIL: Are you calling the airport again?

434
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,656
LANA: Cyril shut your goddamn mouth!

435
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,919
CHERYL/CAROL: [ Involuntary
shudder of pleasure ]

436
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,589
KRIEGER: Hey, guess
what's not a good time?

437
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,690
Wait, where?!

438
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,292
PAM: Gotta be somewhere in there...
KRIEGER: Not you!

439
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,594
And did you count right?!

440
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,662
PAM: What, to five?

441
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,730
Dicknuts?

442
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,430
LANA: Krieger!

443
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,399
KRIEGER: Look, you gotta
keep him away from the lab!

444
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,869
We're almost done, if somebody
can find their last beer!

445
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,138
PAM: [ Burps ] I can
promise it ain't my last.

446
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,209
KRIEGER: I mean, I doubt he can find it...
ARCHER: God damn it.

447
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,679
I told 'em, I said -- Maps!

448
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,214
All through the HVAC ducts!

449
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,184
Or just at the, whatever, junctions.

450
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,889
MALORY: I won't even waste however much
dryerase it'll take to write that down.

451
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,658
ARCHER: No, Mother, because you
were too busy wasting it on

452
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,661
"Fourth of Ju-Luau!"

453

KRIEGER: But still, see
if you can flush him out.

454
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,565
I'd hate to use the nerve gas.

455
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,400
LANA: Do not!

456
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,967
Use the nerve gas!

457
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,705
KRIEGER: And yet incredibly single...
LANA: How the hell do we flush him out?

458
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,240
CHERYL/CAROL: Uh, duh...
REPAIRMAN: Huh?!

459
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,612
LANA: I said, how hot can you make it?

460
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,720
ARCHER: No no no... It's already happening...
LANA: Holy shit, already?

461
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,255
GILLETTE: Yeah, I actually
feel pretty good.

462
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,557
How is that possible?

463
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,492
KRIEGER: It's a proprietary blend.

464
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,262
And barring some sort of massive infection --
PAM: Don't look at me,

465
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,731
found number six!

466
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,265
KRIEGER: You should be
up and around by Monday.

467
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,934
GILLETTE: Well then can I go home?

468
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,303
Cause it's hot as balls up in here.

469
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,406
ARCHER: The thermostat's
becoming sentient!

470
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,273
Oh God!

471
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:07,245
That's how Maximum Overdrive started!

472
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,958
MALORY: Well I'd be lying if I said I cared...
LANA: Wh-?

473
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,827
Malory, Ray can walk again!

474
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,261
GILLETTE: Buh-duh-buh-baaaaa!

475
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,295
MALORY: You mean mince?

476
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,630
GILLETTE: Ya know...
MALORY: Maybe he can mince to

477
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,300
the bank and apply for a twelve
thousand dollar loan for a new furnace!

478
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,236
Why did you idiots leave it
on ninety all weekend?!

479
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,297
ARCHER: Your clothes.

480
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:37,371
Give them to me.

481
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,907
CYRIL: Aaagh!

482
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:43,411
ARCHER: I'm kidding, obviously, I wouldn't
be caught dead in a sweater vest.

483
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:48,464
Now, if you'll excuse me...
PAM: Just like Fourth of Ju-Luau...

484
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,753
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, if you
slid a pig under him.

485
00:19:52,894 --> 00:20:03,428
