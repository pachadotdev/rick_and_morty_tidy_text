00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,760
[Jonathan] Nancy!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,300
[panting] Nancy!

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,760
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,430
Nancy!

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
Where are you?

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,770
[Nancy echoing] Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,940
Jonathan!

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,360
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,190
Nancy!

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,530
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,740
Nancy!

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,410
[Nancy] Jonathan, where are you?

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,120
Jonathan! [breathing heavily]

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,910
Jonathan!

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,120
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
- [faintly] Where are you?
- [panting]

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,750
- I'm right here!
- [Nancy] Jonathan!

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,210
I'm right here! Nancy!

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,510
- Just follow my voice!
- [panting] Jonathan!

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,840
[Jonathan in distance]
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,680
- [growling]
- [gasps]

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,180
Nancy!

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,230
[panting]

24
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,270
- [growling continues]
- [breathing heavily]

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,150
[squelching]

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,570
[growling continues]

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,130
Nancy?

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,720
Nancy.

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,850
[Jonathan in distance] Nancy!
Follow my voice!

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
[monster growling]

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,770
Nancy?

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,530
[Jonathan gasps]

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,280
- [Nancy] Jonathan!
- Nancy!

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,450
- [Nancy straining]
- [Jonathan grunting]

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,380
[Nancy sobbing]

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,500
[Jonathan panting] I got you.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,310
[theme music playing]

38
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,250
[pop song playing on car stereo]

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,816
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,090
- She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
- That's... that's not it.

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,850
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

42
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,600
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,600
So what? [scoffs]
Like, you're worried about her?

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,100
- What?
- Aw, you are.

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,900
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,626
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

47
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,990
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,400
[chuckling] Jeez.

49
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,410
- [Carol] Damn. Sorry.
- [Tommy chuckles]

50
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,210
[sighs] So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,960
[Steve] I'll just be a minute.

52
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,386
[Joyce] Look, we gotta
go through this again.

53
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,200
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

54
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,620
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

55
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,830
There was a laboratory.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,566
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

57
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,630
[inhales deeply]

58
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,130
There was this kid's room.

59
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,880
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

61
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,850
Because, I told you,

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,696
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal...

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,406
[stammers] You didn't say
there was a drawing.

64
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,326
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

65
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,690
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

66
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,020
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

67
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,400
[sighs]

68
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,780
Wasn't Will.

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,960
Earl...

70
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,840
The night that Benny died,

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,220
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,050
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,930
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

74
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,350
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

75
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,520
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,020
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

77
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,480
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

78
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,690
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,450
I've been looking for Will...

80
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,490
I've been chasing after some other kid?

81
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,180
- [Jonathan gasps]
- [monster growling]

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,340
- [growling]
- [gasps]

83
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
[Jonathan] Nancy!

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,730
[monster growls]

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,240
Better?

86
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah.

87
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,080
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,760
I can go home.
[stammers] I just figured...

89
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,750
Yeah, no.
I... [stammers]

90
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,130
- I don't wanna be alone.
- [sighs]

91
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,260
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,850
[sighs]

93
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,210
Can you just come up here?

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah.

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,650
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- [softly] On.

96
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,150
[softly] Yeah.

97
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,370
You know, it...

98
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,200
it can't get us in here.

99
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,170
We don't know that.

100
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

101
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,700
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

102
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,660
Mmm-hmm.

103
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,330
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,580
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

105
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,670
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

106
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,720
Did you get it?

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
- I got it.
- Okay.

108
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,740
[grunting softly]

109
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,490
[pages rustling]

110
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh...

111
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,790
Hey.

112
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,290
[Nancy] Hey.

113
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,500
[grunts] Couldn't sleep?

114
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,920
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

115
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,550
keep seeing that... thing.

116
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,060
Wherever I was, that place...

117
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,730
I think that it lives there.

118
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,650
It was feeding there.

119
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,780
Feeding on that deer.

120
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,240
That means that if...
[inhales deeply]

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,740
if Will and Barbara...

122
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,830
Hey.

123
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,580
My mom said she talked to Will.

124
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,000
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,090
That means that she's trapped...

126
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,510
in that place.

127
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,260
We have to find it again.

128
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,310
You wanna go back out there?

129
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,180
Maybe we don't have to.

130
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,560
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

131
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,770
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

132
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,940
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

133
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,740
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

134
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,990
It's always alone, like...

135
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,120
like a bear.

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,540
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,210
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

138
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,500
One sec.

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,960
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

140
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

141
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,340
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

142
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,090
So you're saying it can detect blood?

143
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,180
[softly] It's just a theory.

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,180
We could test it.

145
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
But if it works...

146
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,270
At least we'll know it's coming.

147
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,490
- [door knob rattles]
- [both gasp]

148
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,070
- [Nancy sighs]
- [Karen] Honey, are you up?

149
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,660
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

150
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,280
[Karen] I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

151
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll be down in a second.

152
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,620
- [footsteps receding]
- [sighing]

[Jonathan sighing]

154
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,590
- [sighs]
- Your mom doesn't knock?

155
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,180
[both chuckle]

156
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,430
[knocking on door]

157
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,110
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

158
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,230
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

159
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,546
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

160
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,820
Oh, wonderful.

161
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,410
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

162
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,410
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

163
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,410
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

164
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,910
Oh, that's neat.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,646
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke...

166
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,290
Uh, please, call me Scott.

167
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,920
Scott.

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,920
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

169
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,010
and give them
the support and encouragement

170
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,090
to pursue careers in technology.

171
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,946
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

172
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

174
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,400
Oh, I have a few in mind.

175
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,870
[Mike sighs] I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

176
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,016
- [Dustin] She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,636
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

178
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,830
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

179
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,226
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

180
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,840
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

181
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
It wasn't his fault, either.

182
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,220
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

183
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,010
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

184
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,640
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

185
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,400
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

186
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,670
No, Mike, you give me a break!

187
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

188
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,810
I was the only reasonable one.

189
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,560
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

190
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,520
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

191
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,360
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

192
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

193
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,110
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,990
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

195
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,950
- No.
- Good.

196
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,580
Where are we going?

197
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,960
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

198
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,960
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

199
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,880
[door opens]

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,510
[breathing heavily]

201
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,650
Today is a very special day.

202
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,440
Do you know why?

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Because today, we make history.

204
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,280
Today, we make contact.

205
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,120
[breathing heavily]

206
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,960
[birds chirping]

207
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,240
[sighing]

208
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,120
[breathing heavily]

209
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,750
[screams]

210
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,210
[birds chirping]

211
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,960
[Karen] Here you go.

212
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,090
Ah... yum.

213
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,510
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

214
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,640
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

215
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,930
[sighs] She is.

216
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,060
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

217
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
- Nancy, what's taking so long?
- [music playing faintly]

218
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,230
Nancy?

219
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,980
- [door knob rattles]
- [sighs] Nancy, come on.

220
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,990
- [sighs]
- [music continues]

221
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,170
Nan...

222
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,270
[doorbell rings]

223
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,150
What do you want?

224
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,280
[sighs] I drew first blood, so...

225
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Okay, I'll shake.

226
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,300
On one condition.

227
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,430
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

228
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,930
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

229
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,720
- Fine!
- [Dustin] No, no, not fine!

230
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,100
Guys, seriously?

231
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,440
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

232
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,360
[sighs] We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

233
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
and those trolls took us out one by one.

234
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,160
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

235
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,120
So we stick together, no matter what!

236
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,120
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

237
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,130
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

238
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,460
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor...

239
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,340
She was just trying to keep us safe!

240
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,026
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

241
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,260
An accident?

242
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,300
All right, accident or not...

243
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,430
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

244
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,230
I could have been killed!

246
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,100
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

247
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,416
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

248
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,730
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

249
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,690
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

250
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,860
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

251
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,240
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

252
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

253
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,430
[upbeat music playing on PA]

254
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,190
[indistinct chatter]

255
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,556
[Dr. Brenner] <i>It's okay, Eleven.</i>

256
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,040
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

257
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,210
They're just here to watch.

258
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,090
Don't focus on them.

259
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,710
Stay in here, like before.

260
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,380
Yes, Papa.

261
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,850
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

262
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,520
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

263
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,730
It's reaching out to you...

264
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,650
'cause it wants you.

265
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,360
Hmm?

266
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,650
It's calling you...

267
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,490
so don't turn away from it this time.

268
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,910
I want you to find it.

269
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,080
Understand?

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Yes.

271
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
[man] <i>Are you lost?</i>

272
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,540
Is your mom here?

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,210
Your dad?

274
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,170
Mouth breather.

275
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,310
- What should we do?
- Uh...

276
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,770
Call the police.

277
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,820
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

278
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,610
- Hey! Stop right...
- [woman screams]

279

- Please.
- [woman grunts]

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,870
Stop right there!
Thief! Thief!

00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,480
Can I help you?

284
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

285
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,650
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

286
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,370
And you want to talk to my sister?

287
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,290
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

288
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,960
Okay, well, you can come in,

289
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,170
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

290
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,340
you're about five years too late.

291
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,840
[TV playing indistinctly]

292
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
Terry, you have some visitors.

293
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,430
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

294
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,560
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

295
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,020
Um, you see, uh, my son...

296
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

297
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,610
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

298
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,320
about your daughter, Jane?

299
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,410
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

300
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,200
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

301
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,490
You guys keep in touch?

302
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,210
This is, uh... this is him.

303
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,750
[stammering] This is Will.

304
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,590
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

305
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,920
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

306
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,720
I told you, you're wasting your time.

307
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,920
[Dustin] This is weird without Lucas.

308
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,880
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

309
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,930
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,560
[sighs] Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

311
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,440
He's your best friend, right?

312
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,520
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

313
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,110
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

314
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,530
But none of that matters.

315
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,280
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

316
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,756
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

317
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,716
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

318
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,250
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

319
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,920
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,460
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

321
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,000
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

322
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,760
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

323
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,510
- [chuckles] Yeah, right.
- [sighs] I mean, he is, but so are you.

324
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,010
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

325
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,810
- Says who?
- Says logic.

326
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,480
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,520
Okay.

328
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,650
[panting]

329
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
Whoa.

330
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,530
- [indistinct conversations]
- [Dustin] You don't think...

331
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,030
[panting] Uh... definitely.

332
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,800
[audience applauding on TV]

333
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,210
[host on TV] <i>Are you ready?</i>

334
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,050
[Becky] She was a part of some study
in college.

335
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,510
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

336
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,350
[exhales] Was, uh, started in the '50s.

337
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,850
By the time Terry got involved,

338
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,140
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

339
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,770
Messed her up good.

340
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,190
This was the CIA that ran this?

341
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,900
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

342
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450
[sighing] They'd pay... you know,

343
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,490
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

344
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

345
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,120
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

346
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,040
- Isolation tanks?
- [Becky] Yeah.

347
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,170
These big bathtubs, basically,

348
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,880
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

349
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,630
You lose any sense of, uh...

350
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,510
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

351
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,890
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

352
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,350
Real hippie crap.

353
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,076
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

354
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,350
The thing is, though, is that

355
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,520
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

356
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,110
Jane.

357
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,440
[sighs]

358
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,990
Do you have any pictures of her?

359
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,080
I don't think you guys understand.

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,370
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

361
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,590
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

362
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,720
[sighs]

363
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

364
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,560
- like she's gonna come home someday.
- [lullaby plays from mobile]

365
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,100
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

366
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,980
Abilities?

367
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,860
[bones cracking]

368
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,650
You read any Stephen King?

[chuckles]

372
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,280
You guys look scared, actually.

373
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,200
[chuckles] I mean, it's all make-believe.

374
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,120
[clears throat]
What... what kind of abilities?

375
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,920
Telepathy, telekinesis...

376
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,630
[Eleven screams]

377
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,800
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

378
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,840
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

379
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,390
[yelling] Papa!

380
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,470
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

381
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,730
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

382
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,520
You know, to deal with the guilt.

383
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

384
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,940
[stammering] About having had the kid.

385
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,820
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

386
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,990
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

387
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

388
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,250
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

389
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh, man.

390

And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

393
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,000
What you kids doin' with all this?

394
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,420
Um...

395
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,300
- Monster hunting.
- Huh. [scoffs]

396
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,510
[cash register dings]

397
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,680
"Monster hunting"?

398
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,060
You know, last week...

399
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,980
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

400
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,900
It took me and Barb all weekend.

401
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,860
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now...

402
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,490
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

403
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,530
Yeah.

404
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,030
What's the weirdest part?

405
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,370
Me or the bear trap?

406
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,620
You.
It's definitely you.

407
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,130

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,550
Can't wait to see your movie. [laughs]

410
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,010
What the hell was that?

411
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,800
I don't know.

412
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,560
What?

413
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,770
What?

414
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,440
Hey! Where are you going?

415
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,770
- [panting]
- Nancy, wait!

416
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,190
[whimpers]

417
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,650
Nancy!

418
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,210
[man 1] I can't believe it.
[man 2] These kids!

419
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,620
- [Jonathan] Jesus.
- [sighs]

420

Wow.

[Jonathan] Wait!

423
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,076
[Carol] Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

424
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,116
[Tommy] Shut up!
[Nicole] I didn't know you could spell.

425
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,220
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]

Aw, hey there, princess!

429
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,780
[Tommy] Uh-oh! She looks upset.

430
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,320
[Carol] Oh!
[Tommy] Damn!

431
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,740
What is wrong with you?

432
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,176
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

433
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,740
I was worried about you.

434
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,966
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you. [scoffs]

435
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,250
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

436
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,500
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

437
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,790
Speak of the devil.

438
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,130
Hi.

439
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,970
You came by last night?

440
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,550
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

441
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,390
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

442
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,850
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

443
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,520
Or for another
pervy photo session? [laughs]

444
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,206
- We were just...
- [Steve] You were just what?

445
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,820
Finish that sentence.

446
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,780
Finish the sentence.

447
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,570
[breathing heavily]

448
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,290
[scoffs] Go to hell, Nancy.

449
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,500
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

450
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,186
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

451
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,806
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

452
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,840
a little screw-up like your father.

453
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

454
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,236
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

455
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,526
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

456
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,776
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

457
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,696
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

458
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,760
[Nancy] Steve, shut up!

459
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,906
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

460
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,786
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

- [both continue grunting]

Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

Stop! You're going to hurt him!

We're gonna find him.

Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

We're close.

502

[breath trembling] Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her...

503
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,026
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

504
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,290
which means we've got a chance.

505
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,050
You know what I would give?

506
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,340
For a chance?

507

You, yes. Him, no.

[chuckles] He's not my boyfriend.

519
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,970
I think you better tell him that.

520
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
What?

521
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Only love makes you that crazy,
