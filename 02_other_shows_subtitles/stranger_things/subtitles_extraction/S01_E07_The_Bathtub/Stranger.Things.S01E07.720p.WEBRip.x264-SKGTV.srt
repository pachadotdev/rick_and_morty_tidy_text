00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,970
[Mike sighs] That's better.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,230
You don't need it.

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,520
Still pretty?

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Yeah!

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,360
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
El?

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,990
Yes?

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,250
[stammers] Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,830
Me, too.

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,970
- [door opens]
- Guys!

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,850
[panting] It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,616
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,220
- [Mike] Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,310
[Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio]

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,350
What's he saying?

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,480
I don't know, he's way out of range.

17
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,520
[Lucas] <i>...son of a bitch!</i>

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,730
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,400
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,240
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,370
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,950
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,710
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,460
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,870
Like a code name or something?

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,420
- [Lucas] <i>The bad men are coming!</i>
- "Bad men."

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,130
- Bad men!
- [radio static]

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,130
[gasps] Stay here.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,730
[Mike] What's that guy doing?

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,730
You don't think...

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,036
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,230
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,110
[stammers] Well, is he home?

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,296
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,676
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on, please?

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,886
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times...

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,820
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,580
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,356
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong...

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,630
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- [Dustin] Mike!

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,680
- One second.
- [yells] Mike!

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,680
We need to leave...
[panting] right now.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,730
- [sighs]
- Michael!

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,610
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,770
What?

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,740
[Dustin grunts]

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,510
[Dustin] Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Holy... holy shit!

Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

71

No, Dustin, we missed it.

[Lucas panting]

74
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,090
It was awesome.

75
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,810
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,520
I was wrong.

77

I'm sorry.

Hey.

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,680
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

85
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,986
- [Callahan] Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

86
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,470
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

87
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,680
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

88
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,060
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

89
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,230
- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

90
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

91
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,780
What is this?

92
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,506
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

93
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,210
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,516
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

95
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,210
I wanna see you in my office.

96
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,630
You won't believe me.

97
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,710
[softly] Why don't you give me a try?

98

Mr. Wheeler?

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,710
Yes?

[men speaking indistinctly]

[Karen stuttering] <i>I don't understand.</i>

You think my son is hiding this girl?

109
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,220
What happened to her hair?

110
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,840
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

111
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,140
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

112
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,930
Our son with a girl?

113
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,310
[chuckles] I mean, believe me,

114
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,730
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

115
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,400
Wouldn't we?

116
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
[Karen sighs]

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,320
This girl...

118
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
what has she done?

119
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

120
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,716
- Oh, my God, is she Russian?
- [stammers]

121
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,870
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

122
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,660
You come into my house,

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,250
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

124
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,460
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

125
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,380
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

126
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,300
[sighs]

127
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,060
I understand how upsetting this is.

128
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,350
I wish we could tell you more...

129
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,730
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

130
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,660
We want to help him.

131
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,530
We will help him.
I give you my word.

132
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,500
But in order for me to do that...

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
you have to trust me.

134
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,040
Will you trust me?

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,010
Good.

136
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,260
Now...

137
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,640
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

138
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,980
[Lucas] This is Randolph Road, right here.

139
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,610
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

140
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,650
And this is the lab right here.

141
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,256
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

142
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
It's gotta be.

143
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,280
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

144
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,846
The sign says "Department of Energy."

145
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,000
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

146
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,040
It means government. Military.

147
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,356
- [Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

148
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,896
It's military. My dad's told me before.

149
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,670
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

150
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,800
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

151
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,090
[Mike] No, weapons...

152
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,736
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,300
[Lucas] Weapons.

154
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,760
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

155
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,640
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

156
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,770
Well, what do we do?

157
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,520
[Mike] I don't know,
but we can't go home.

158
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,020
We're fugitives now.

159
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,400
[helicopter approaching]

160
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,730
[stutters] Guys?

161
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,570
Do you hear that?

162
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,096
[Mike] Go, go, go, go!
[Dustin] Come on, come on!

163
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,846
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

164
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,176
[Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
[Lucas] Come on!

165
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,620
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go!

166
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,170
[helicopter whirring]

167
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,500
- [panting]
- [Lucas] Get down!

168
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,800
[helicopter receding]

169
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,260
Mental.

170
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,180
[Joyce sighs]

171
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,190
You say blood draws this thing?

172
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,600
We don't know.

173
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,860
It's just a theory.

174
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,150
[Jonathan] <i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,240
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

176
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,120
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

177
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,676
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

178
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,290
I wanted to tell you, I just...

179
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,620
What if this thing took you, too?

180
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,000
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

181
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,550
[stammers] I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

182
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,010
This is not yours to fix alone.

183
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,930
[stammers] You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

184
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,140
You're not alone.

185
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,600
I know.

186
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,100
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.

187
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,890
- I know.
- Damn it.

188
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,850
[sniffling]

189
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,036
[Troy's mom] I want an apology!

190
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,296
[Callahan] An apology for what, exactly?

191
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,126
[Troy's mom] Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

192
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,490
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

193
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,400
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

194
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,660
What is your name, Deputy?

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,530
Well, I'm an officer...
[chuckles] okay?

196
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,136
[Troy's mom] Name and badge number,
both of you!

197
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,096
- What the hell is going on here?
- [Powell] Chief...

198
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,080
These men are humiliating my son.

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,686
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

201
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,380
A psychotic child broke his arm!

202
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,710
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

203
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,106
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

204
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,606
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

205
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,220
Will you please take a statement...
[mouthing] and get her out?

206
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,526
- [Callahan] Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

207
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,720
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

208
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,730
Like a freak.

209
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,940
What'd you just say?

210
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,150
I said she's a freak!

211
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,020
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

212
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,030
Her head's shaved.

213
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,860
She doesn't even look like a girl.

214
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
And...

215
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,120
And what?

216
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,200
Tell the man, Troy.

217
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,870
She can...

218
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,420
do things.

219
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,790
What kind of things?

220
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,920
Like...

221
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,340
make you fly.

222
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,640
And piss yourself.

223
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
What?

224
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,310
Was she alone?

225
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,600
She always hangs out with those losers.

226
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,850
"Losers"?

227
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,480
What losers?

228
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,650
Hey.

229
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,280
You owe me $1.20.

230
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,466
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

231
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,160
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

232
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,886
The cops should just lock him up forever.

233
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,500
- Did you see the look on his face?
- [Steve groans]

234
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,420
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

235
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,896
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

236
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,430
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

237
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,906
- while he and Nancy are screwing.
- [chuckles]

238
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,826
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

239
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,560
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

240
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,980
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

241
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,456
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

242
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,536
You shouldn't have done that.

243
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,860
- Done what?
- You know what.

244
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,820
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

245
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,216
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

246
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,966
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

247
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,670
- What the hell, Steve?
- [Steve] You know,

248
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,846
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

249
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,530
because she's not miserable like you two.

250
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,096
She actually cares about other people.

251
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,370
The slut with a heart of gold.

252
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,690
I told you to watch your mouth!

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,040
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

254
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,440
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
- Or what?
- [grunts]

256
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,170
Or what?

257
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,840
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

258
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,040
You gonna fight me now, too?

259
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,380
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

260
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,220
so I wouldn't recommend that.

261
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,310
[car door opens]

262
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,456
- Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
- [door slams]

263
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,280
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

264
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,860
Run away!
Just like you always do.

265
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,280
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,660
- [tires screeching]
- That's right, Harrington, run away!

267
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,370
Run away! [scoffs]

268
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,550
[Nancy] I have to go home.

269
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,130
No, you can't.

270
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,970
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

271
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,520
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

272
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,286
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

273
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,770
The last thing in the world we need

274
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,570
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

275
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,190
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

276
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,570
Not yet, at least.

277
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,320
[helicopter whirring]

278
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,900
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

279
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,370
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

280
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,846
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

281
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,660
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

282
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,460
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

283
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,380
I mean, lately... [sighs]

284
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,686
Is there any place that your...

285
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,670
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,880
- [stuttering] I don't know.
- I might.

287
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,050
What?

288
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,140
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

289
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,610
Whoa.

290
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,700
I got it.

291
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,620
[helicopter hovering]

292
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,250
[Nancy on radio] <i>Mike,</i>
<i>are you there? Mike?</i>

293
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,670
You guys hear that?

294
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,880
<i>Mike, it's me, Nancy.</i>

295
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,630
<i>Mike, are you there?</i>

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>Answer.</i>

297
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,140
<i>Mike, we need you to answer.</i>

298
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Is that your sister?

299
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,390
This is an emergency, Mike.

300
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,770
Do you copy?

301
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,440
Mike, do you copy?

302
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,060
Okay, this is really weird.

303
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,650
Don't answer.

304
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,876
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

305
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,650
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

306
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,620
- What if they're forcing her to say this?
<i>- I need you to answer.</i>

307
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,240
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

308
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,080
<i>We need to know
that you're there, Mike.</i>

309
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,620
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

310
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,766
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

311
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,840
Why is she with the chief?

312
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,276
How the hell does he know about...

313
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,220
[Hopper] <i>We can protect you,</i>
<i>we can help you, but you gotta pick up.</i>

314
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,930
<i>Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.</i>

315
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,930
[sighs]

316
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,850
Anybody got any other ideas?

317
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,940
[Mike] <i>Yeah, I copy.</i>

318
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,980
<i>It's Mike.</i>

319
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm here.

320
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,030
We're here.

321
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,170
[Steve] Need a hand?

322
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,420
Did you have something
to do with this?

323
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,590
I just...

324
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,760
I wanna help.

325
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,480
All yours.

326
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,080
[sighs] They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

327
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,790
We should be out there looking for him.

328
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,660
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

329
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,540
This is our government.
They're on our side.

330
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,630
[Karen sighs]

331
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,550
That man gives me the creeps.

332
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,260
Nancy.

333
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,800
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

334
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,300
Nancy with Mike?

335
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,850
[chuckles] No.

336
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,930
- No.
- [sighs]

337
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,150
[Dustin breathing heavily]

338
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,780
Will you stop pacing?

339
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,820
It's been way too long.

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,830
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

341
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,676
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

342
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
It's not a trap.

343
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,790
Why would the chief set us up?

344
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,040
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

345
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,500
Lando Calrissian.

346
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,250
Would you shut up about Lando?

347
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,316
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

348
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,220
[shouting] When do you feel good
about anything?

349
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,300
[vehicles approaching]

350
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,230
[Dustin] Shit!

351
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,650
[Mike] Go, go, go, go.

352
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,610
[panting] Lando.

353
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,440
You think they saw us?

354
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,200
Both of you, shut up.

355
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,240
[grunts]

356
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,506
- [man 1] Hey!
- [blows landing]

357
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,830
[man 1 grunts]

358
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,240
[man 2] What the...
[grunting]

359
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
[door creaks]

360
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
[breathing heavily] All right, let's go.

361
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,260
Let's go!

362
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,780
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

363
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,660
I was so worried about you.

364
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah, uh... me, too.

365
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,880
Is that my dress?

366
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,550
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

367
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,560
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

368
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,020
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

369
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,560
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

370
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,286
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

371
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,610
With our compasses.

372
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,820
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

373
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,110
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

374
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,410
Is this gate underground?

375
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,160
[Eleven] Yes.

376
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,250
Near a large water tank?

377
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes.

378
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,460
[stutters] How do you know all that?

379
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,630
He's seen it.

380
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,550
[Joyce] Is there any way that you could...

381
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,356
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this...

382
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,470
The Upside Down.

383
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,180
[whispering] Down. Yeah.

384
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,036
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara?

385
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,520
Can you find her, too?

386
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,440
[static]

387
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,780
[static increases]

388
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,710
[static becomes faint]

389
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,970
What?

391
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,180
[stuttering] What's wrong?
What happened?

392
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,930
[voice breaks] I can't find them.

393
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,790
[turns faucet off]

394
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,720
[Mike] <i>Whenever she uses her powers,</i>
<i>she gets weak.</i>

395
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,350
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

396
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,020
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

397
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,390
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

398
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,360
Well... [stutters]
How do we make her better?

399
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,270
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

400
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,190
[Nancy] Well, how long?

401
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,650
I don't know.

402
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,990
[Eleven] The bath.

403
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,320
[Joyce] What?

404
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,620
I can find them.

405
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,160
In the bath.

406
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,460
[screaming]

407
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,540
[woman] Oh!

408
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,970
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

409
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,106
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

410
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,390
[sighing] No, what?

411
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,010
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

412
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,970
[woman] No way. Really?

413
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,600
Really.

414
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,270
[phone ringing]

415
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,060
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

416
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,730
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

417
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,740
Hello?

418
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,610
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

419
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,570
Dustin? Is everything okay?

420
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,280
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

421
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,450
I have a science question.

422
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,910
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up...

423
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

424
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,840
Specifically how to build one?

425
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,880
Sensory deprivation?
[stutters] What is this for?

426
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,170
Fun.

427
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,930
Okay. Well...

428
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,180
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

429
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,720
<i>You always say
we should never stop being curious.</i>

430
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,730
To always open any curiosity door we find.

431
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,850
Dustin...

432
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,560
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

433
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,110
[sighs]

434
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,400
Uh-huh.

435
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,190
[indistinct chatter over phone]

436
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,450
Uh-huh. How much?

437
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,410
Uh-huh.

438
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,490
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

439
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,200
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

440
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,556
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

441
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,960
Bye.

442
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,360
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

443
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,710
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

444
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,460
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

445
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,260
How much is "lots"?

446
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,430
1,500 pounds.

447
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,220
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

448
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,400
[Jonathan grunting]

449
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,320
Hey, wait.

450
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

451
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,530
[sighs] Worst case, no school.

452
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,330
Even if we find Will in there...

453
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,960
what are we gonna do about that thing?

454
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,330
We're not gonna do anything.

455
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,896
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

456
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,340
- Your mom's been through enough already.
- He's my brother.

457
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,760
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

458
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,380
You gotta trust me on this.

459
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,180
I am going to find him.

460
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.

461
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,650
Come on.
It's upside down.

462
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,990
[Lucas] No, this way.

463
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,086
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

464
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,620
- Try that side.
- [grunts] Son of a bitch!

465
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

466
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,410
- [Lucas] One, two, three.
- [grunts]

467
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,830
Shit!

468
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,470
[grunts] Ah.

469
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,630
[Nancy] Stand back.

470
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,100
Whoa.

471
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,820
[Nancy] What did she even eat?

472
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,530
- [Mike] What?
- Eleven.

473
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,870
[Mike] Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

474
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,210
She really likes Eggos.

475
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,500
[Nancy] I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

476
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,630
I thought it was because of Will.

477
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,590
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

478
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,090
Hey...
