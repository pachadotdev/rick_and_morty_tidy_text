00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,280
[coughs]

165
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

166
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,620
Can you show that to me, please?

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,330
How's your mom doing?

168
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,010
I don't know.

169
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,470
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

170
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,760
Will and the thing in the wall?

171
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,730
Since the first phone call, I guess.

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

173
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,690
in the past.

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,690
But this...

175
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,410
I don't know.

176
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,700
[breathes deeply]

177
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm worried it could be...

178
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,210
Ugh, I don't know.

179
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,090
She'll be okay.

180
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,510
We'll be okay.

181
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,260
My mom...

182
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,980
she's tough. [chuckles]

183
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah, she is.

184
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,480
Hey.

185
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,270
She is.

186
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,490
[coroner] Ma'am!

187
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,170
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

188
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,990
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,830
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

190
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,040
- Mom!
- [coroner] Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

191
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,380
- [school bell ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

192
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,340
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

193
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,800
To look for Barb.

194
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,970
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

195
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,680
That's crazy.

196
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,310
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,060
just hanging out in my yard?

199
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,890
I don't think it was a mask.

200
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,770
But he had no face?

201
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,770
I don't know!

202
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,730
I don't know, I just...

203
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,400
I have a terrible feeling about this.

204
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,530
Oh, this is bad.

205
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,160
This is really bad.

206
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,280
What?

207
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
The cops...

208
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,080
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

210
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,710
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

211
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,750
Are you serious right now?

212
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,920
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

213
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,510
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

214
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,930
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

215
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,930
don't mention the beers.

216
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,810
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

217
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,020
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

218
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,060
[scoffs] I can't believe you right now.

219
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,150
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

220
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,150
Nancy, wait!

221
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,070
Nancy!

222
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,096
- [Jonathan] Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

223
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,540
[stammers] I need to think.
Just go on home.

224
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,580
Mom, will you just get in, please?

225
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,880
Mom.

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,710
Mom!

227
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,170
Mom.

228
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,640
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

229
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,470
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

230
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,970
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

231
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
We have to deal with the funeral!

232
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,310
The funeral?

233
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,310
For... for who?
[loudly] For that thing back there?

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
Okay, let me get this straight.

235
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,690
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

236
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,610
And there's a monster in the wall?

237
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,200
Do you even hear yourself?

238
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
I know it sounds crazy.

239
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,620
[stammers] I sound crazy!

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

241
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,750
It is crazy!

242
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

243
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,420
He talked to me!

244
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Will is... is calling to me!

245
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,300
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

246
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,340
I don't care if anyone believes me!

247
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,010
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

248
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,180
[shouting] I am going to bring him home!

249
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,060
[yelling] Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

250
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,650
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

251
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,030
[Jonathan panting]

253
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,200
All right, show's over.

254
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
What?

255
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,170
- [radio frequencies tuning]
- [indistinct whimpering]

256
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,340
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

257
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,840
[Lucas] Yeah, I heard a baby.

258
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,970
What?

259
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,850
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

260
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,570
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

261
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,390
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,770
- That was Will!
- Mike...

263
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,060
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

264
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,360
Words!

265
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,190
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

266
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,490
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess...

267
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,886
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

268
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,966
I don't think it's about that.

269
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,660
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

270
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,410
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,160
Are you actually believing this crap?

272
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't know, I mean...

273
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,040
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

274
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,340
He sounded a lot like that.

275
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Did you guys not see what I saw?

276
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,800
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

277
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,430
He's dead!

278
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

279
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,036
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

280
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,740
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

281
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,900
I don't know!

282
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,190
All I know is Will is alive.

283
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,730
Will is alive!

284
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,150
He's out there somewhere.

285
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,860
All we have to do is find him.

286
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,700
[static crackling on radio]

287
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,990
This isn't gonna work.

288
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

289
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,040
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

290
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,170
The Heathkit's at school.

291
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

292
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,470
I mean... look at her.

293
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,550
Wow.

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
- She looks...
- Pretty.

295
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,100
Good.

296
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,480
You look pretty good.

297
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,000
[whispers] Pretty.

298
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,960
Good.

299
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,840
Clear.

300
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,470
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

301
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,260
Good luck in there, son.

302
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
[low growling]

303
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,880
[monster growling]

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

305
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,410
bearing us down towards the sea

306
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,250
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

307
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,000
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too..."

308
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,550
Nancy Wheeler?

309
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,510
If you'll come with me, please?

310
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,930
[Powell] This argument
you and Barbara had?

311
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,640
What exactly was it about?

312
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,850
[Nancy] It wasn't really an argument.

313
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,810
Barb just wanted to leave.

314
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,030
I didn't, so, I...

315
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,650
I told her to just go home.

316
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,860
Then what?

317
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,660
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

318
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,620
And the next day, you went back and...

319
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,120
saw a bear, you're thinking?

320
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't know what it was, but...

321
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,130
I think...

322
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,220
I think maybe it took Barb.

323
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,590
- You need to check behind Steve's house...
- We did.

324
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,010
There's nothing there.

325
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,770
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

326
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,020
- What?
- [Callahan] Look.

327
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,350
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

328
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

329
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

330
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,360
Leaving town, maybe?

331
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,570
No.

332
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,860
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

333
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,320
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

334
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,620
Uh, Steve Harrington?

335
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,330
What? No!

336
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,580
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

337
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,750
It wasn't like that.

338
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,960
Like what?

339
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,920
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,750
We... we just talked.

341
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,880
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

342
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,906
[Hopper] So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

343
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,140
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

344
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,480
They're all Staties?

345
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,690
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

347
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,570
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

348
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,570
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

349
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,660
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

350
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,580
Considering what?

351
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,790
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

She's here for Will's funeral.

I don't know what your budget is,

we have copper and bronze.

Can we talk for a second?

499
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,400
[Jonathan] It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

500
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,520
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

anyone else out there?

No.

505
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,580
And she was there one second
and then, um...

506
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,210
gone.

507
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,920
I figured she bolted.

508
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,340
The cops think that she ran away.

And I went back to Steve's...

511
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,760

512
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,640
saw something.

513
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,020

I'm so sorry.

What?

521
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,580

[stammers] I don't know.

What's her name?

Her name's Sarah.

00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,080
- [Will] <i>Mom!</i>
- Will!

650
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,590
I'm here! I'm here!

651
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,880
- Oh, God...
- [echoing] <i>Mom!</i>

652
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,920
- Will!
- Will, it's us! Are you there?

653
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,380
Can you hear us?
We're here!

654
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,470
[Will distorted] <i>Hello? Mom?</i>

655
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,590
Why can't he hear us?

656
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,890
I don't know!

657
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,760
Baby...

658
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,640
- Mom?
- Oh, God. Will!

659
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,730
[echoing] Mom!

660
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,770
[Joyce] Oh, thank God.

661
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,650
[crying] Baby...

662
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,770
Will...

663
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,980
- [monster growling]
- Mom...

664
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,400
Mom, it's coming!

665
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,700
Tell me where you are!
How do I get to you?

666
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,280
[echoing] <i>It's like home,</i>
<i>but it's so dark...</i>

667
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,240
<i>It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold!</i>

668
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,540
<i>Mom? Mom!</i>

669
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,920
Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

670
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,830
But right now, I need you to hide.

671
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,290
Mom, please!

672
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,960
- No, no, listen! Listen, I...
- [growling continues]

673
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,010
I will find you, but you have to run now!

674
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,430

- El, are you okay?
- [Lucas] Oh!

681
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,710
Can you move?

682
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,130
Here, help her up.

687
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,260
[Nancy] And you're...

688
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,670
[Jonathan] Brightening.
Enlarging.

689
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,880
[Nancy] Hmm.

690
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,010
- Did your mom say anything else?
- [grunts]

691
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,140
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

692
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,650
- No, just that it came out of the wall.
- [machine dings]

693

[Jonathan sighs]

694
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,100
[Nancy] How long does this take?

695
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,200
Not long.

696
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,080
Have you been...

697
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,000
doing this a while?

698
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,670
What?

699
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,000
Photography?

700
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,710
Yeah.

701
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,800
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

702
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,930
Talk to them.

703
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,970
I know.
It's weird.

704
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,060
No!

705
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,270
[stammers] No, it is.

706
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,850
It's just, sometimes...

707
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,560
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

708
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,400
But you capture the right moment...

709
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,650
it says more.

710
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,110
What was I saying?

711
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,740
What?

712
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,120
When you took my picture.

713
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,450
I shouldn't have taken that.

714
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,660
I'm, uh...

715
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,290
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,670
It's just...

717
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,290
That's it.

718
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,340
That's what I saw.

719

[Jonathan gasps]

720
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,800
My mom...

721
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,850
I thought she was crazy

722
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,680
'cause she said...

723
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,520
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

724
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,270
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

725
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,330
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

726
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,920
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

727
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,710
[laughing] I'll just be a minute.

728
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,890
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

729
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,076
Hey, you can't be back here.

730
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,736
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

731
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

732
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,956
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

733
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,100
I don't work with O'Bannon.

734
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,980
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

735
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,980
[smacks lips] Okay.

736
