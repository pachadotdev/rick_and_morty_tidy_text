1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,753
RICK:
Look, I'm not paying 70 [burps] smidgens

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,463
for a [burps] broken
defraculator.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,675
That is multiphase quantum
resonator.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,510
- Well, does it defraculate?
- Fuck no.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,512
Then -- then -- then
it's a broken defraculator.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,514
Like you would even know dick
about fraculation!

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,224
Your planet
just got cellphones,

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,309
and the coverage
still sucks!

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,436
RICK:
Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,271
So, let's say 60 smidgens.

11
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,981
I tell you what --
I'll do you a favor.

12
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,566
I'll throw in a fart.

13
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,568
Hey, uh, Rick, um,
you think

14
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,404
maybe I could get
something from this place,

15
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,239
like a souvenir, like,
just to have --

16
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,990
like, something cool,
you know?

17
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,534
Not here, Morty.
We'll stop somewhere else.

18
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,828
Because, you know, there's
always another pawn shop.

19
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,830
MORTY:
Oh, okay. I just, um --

20
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,498
you know, I thought that
robot over there

21
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,333
looked pretty cool,
you know?

22
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,794
Oh, it looks cool, huh?
That's why you want it?

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,421
Yeah!
You know, I mean...

24
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,131
it's different
from the stuff on Earth,

25
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,133
and, you know, you take me
to all these crazy places

26
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,676
across the galaxy,

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,678
and, you know, I don't
really have anything to --

28
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,638
to remember all those
trips by.

29
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,640
It'd be kind of cool,
like a souvenir.

30
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,392
You know, like, what if
you passed away

31
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,768
or died
or something?

32
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,562
I wouldn't even have anything
to remember

33
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,355
all the cool stuff
we did, you know?

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,357
Okay. 60 [burps]
for the resonator,

35
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,110
and my grandson
wants the sex robot.

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,102
[ rhythmic creaking ]

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,859
So, we're just going
to pretend this isn't happening?

38
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,944
I'm not saying that's
a bad idea -- just asking.

39
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,780
Rick, why would you
let Morty

40
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,907
bring that
thing into our house?!

41
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,366
I don't know.
What do you want from me?

42
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,744
He thi-- he thou--
he thought it looked cool.

43
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,661
You know what I mean?

44
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,913
Whew!

45
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,625
[ gulping ]

46
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,418
Ahh. All right.

47
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,004
Back to -- back to --
b-back upstairs.

48
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,881
[ footsteps depart,
door closes in distance ]

49
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,841
[ rhythmic creaking ]

50
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,301
Well, I'm intervening.

51
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,969
Intervening with
puberty?

52
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,430
You'll turn him into
Ralph Fiennes in "Red Dragon."

53
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,558
He's at that age.
Let's just be proud of him.

54
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,102
Jesus. Did I really set
the bar that low?

55
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,103
[ footsteps approach ]

56
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,397
Um, Rick, could you
come with me, please --

57
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,607
q-quickly?

58
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,611
Okay, now if we hear squeaking,
we intervene.

59
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,279
[ warbling ]

60
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,114
Where's the sex robot,
Morty?

61
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,325
That is Gwendolyn --
l-I mean, the robot!

62
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,828
She started beeping, transformed
and tried to fly away!

63
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,496
Strange -- that's
usually the man's job.

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,206
You know what I'm talking
about, Morty?

65
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,083
Wubba-lubba-dub-dub!
[ laughs ]

66
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,584
Morty!
[laughs]

67
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,253
That's my
catchphrase, remember?

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,922
Remember -- remember how I --
how I cemented that catchphrase?

69
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,340
All right.
All right, seriously, though,

70
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,550
let me
grab this thing.

71
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,593
[ grunts ]

72
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,470
Come on, you... rascal.

73
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,557
- Okay, unacceptable! Oh.
- What is going on?

74
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,392
- [ giggles ]
- All right. Uh-oh.

75
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,352
"Uh-oh"? What is that?!

76
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,271
Hmm. I think Morty's robot
was designed

77
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,731
for more than long
weekends.

78
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,527
Genetic compiler,
incubation chamber.

79
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,445
Yep. This here's some kind
of baby maker,

80
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,155
and that there's half Morty,
half --

81
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,157
[burps]
who -- who knows wh-what?

82
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,243
It's my bad, guys.
I'll -- I'll take care of it.

83
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,870
- Grandpa Rick, no, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

84
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,538
What do you think
you're doing?!

85
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,331
Hey, listen -- you guys
quarantined the house

86
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,083
when Summer brought olives
back from Mexico.

87
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,252
I mean, this thing could grow
to the size of Delaware.

88
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,671
I mean, it might eat brains
and exhale space AIDS.

89
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,506
We gotta be careful.

90
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,508
I lost the chance
to be careful, Rick.

91
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,843
I'm a father now!

92
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,720
You know, it's time for me
to be responsible.

93
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,555
Isn't that right...
- Don't name it.

94
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,557
- ...Morty Jr.?
- Oh, crap. He named it.

95
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,559
Well, Dad, it's a living thing,
and it's half human.

96
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,270
And it was born on American
soil, which entitles it to --

97
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,272
Jerry, majoring in
Civics was your mistake.

98
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,690
Don't punish us for it.

99
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,233
[ groans ]
Fine.

100
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,028
I'm gonna take this thing
to my workshop and investigate.

101
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,030
Do not let that thing out
of your sight.

102
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,033
Lt looks harmless now,
but it could grow dangerous.

103
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,035
Like The Insane Clown Posse.

104
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,995
Yeah. Good one, Jerry.

105
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,623
2003 just called.
Lt wants its easy target back.

106
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,791
Ohh.
He's like a little me!

107
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,878
Y-You don't think he'll turn
into a monster... do you?

108
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,504
They always do.

109
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,840
Hey, uh, 1995 called!

110
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,342
They want their
"certain year called

111
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,260
wanting its 'blank' back"
formula back!

112
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,304
Why, Jerry?
Why expend the effort?

113
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,556
Life is effort,
and I'll stop when I die!

114
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,602
- Out.
- Whatcha doin'?

115
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,395
Well, I can't solve
the problem my way,

116
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,397
thanks to your family's
primitive biological hang-ups.

117
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,733
Gross. I might have just
touched one of Morty's loads.

118
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,027
But maybe I can find suitable
parents for Morty Jr.

119
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,864
on this robot's home world,
which is...

120
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,866
Gazorpazorp
in the Andromeda system.

121
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,869
Scoot, Summer.
- Don't you need a new companion

122
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,871
now that Morty's
in the family way?

123
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,123
I don't do adventures
with chicks, Summer.

124
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh, right -- because there's
something about having a wiener

125
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,628
that would make me better
at walking through a hole?

126
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,756
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Oh, crap.

127
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,716
Grandpa Rick! Ugh!

128
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,219
Help! Help! Aah! Aah!

129
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,929
[ roars ]

130
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,807
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

131
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,475
- Grandpa Rick!
- Still think it's a good idea

132
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,060
to go through holes
without a wiener?

133
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,562
- I want to go home.
- Yeah, no duh.

134
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,022
Ugh!

135
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,273
[ gasps ]

136
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,733
[ all snarling ]

137
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,735
Great. Now I have to take
over a whole planet

138
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,113
because of your stupid
boobs.

139
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,949
- You're doing great, Morty.
- Really? You think?

140
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,784
I mean, I'm not doing
much of anything.

141
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,119
What do I do if it cries?

142
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,329
Then you put it down
and let it cry itself out.

143
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,915
Yeah, right. We tried
that technique on Summer,

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,126
and she's gonna end up
stripping, isn't she?

145
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,627
Yes, she is.

146
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,629
She's gonna strip
for attention

147
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,631
because she was denied it.

148
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,050
Stop filling it
with your own insecurity.

149
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,219
You're gonna turn it
into Morty --

150
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,430
uh, mm -- more --
more -- more -- more of you.

151
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,265
Well, we can't all be
raised like reptiles

152
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,058
by a mentally ill scientist.

153
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,893
- [ vomits ]
- What the -- aah! Aah!

154
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,812
[ crying ]

155
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,231
Listen to me. I am not
rewarding this behavior.

156
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,899
Knock it off,

Summer, put your burqa on!

That burqa is
a human-rights violation,

00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,810
and I spent a lot
on this top.

Look, I'm trying to

00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,482

to keep these Belushis
from carting you off.

The least you could do is be
ashamed of your gender.

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,197
Ugh. What's the deal
with this place?

178
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,990
Why is it such
a sausage planet,

and how did such backward
idiots invent robots?

Obviously, at some point,

181
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,412
the Gazorpians became
so evolved

182
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,956
that they replaced females
with birthing machines.

183
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,167
The resultant lack of
distraction and hen-pecking

184
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,127
allowed them to focus entirely
on war,

185
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,129
so they bombed themselves back
to the stone age,

and now they just fight with
each other over fake pussy

We built it during the great

when the females separated
from the males

Fertilized surrogates are

The females are placed
into educational programs

where they can discover
a service to our paradise

Out of the -- out of
the way, Morty!

476
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,870
- No!
- Morty!

477
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,663
That's one of the most
violently aggressive

478
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,706
creatures in the universe!

479
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,458
- Ow!
- He's my son!

480
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,336
And if you hurt him, you'll
have to kill me, Rick!

[ growls ]

482
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,594
Dad, I'm so confused!

483
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,305
I know, Morty Jr.
I'm sorry.

484
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,098
I ended up lying to you
and yelling at you

485
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,142
just like my parents
did to me.

486
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,561
You know, parents are just
kids having kids.

487
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,230
One minute, you like
how a shiny robot looks.

488
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,399
The next minute,
you're in a fist fight

489
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,318
with your alien son.

490
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,819
I'm an alien?

491
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,821
We all have bad
impulses, bad thoughts.

492
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,615
We just have to learn
to channel them

493
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,325
into something
constructive.

494
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,911
But I want to murder
everyone I see.

495
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,746
Well, you know, I mean,
maybe there's a job out there

496
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,414
for people that feel
that way.

497

MAN:
Actually, there is.

498
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,876
Hi. I'm Brad Anderson,
creator of

499
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,086
the nationally syndicated
comic strip "Marmaduke."

500
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,088
You should consider being
a creative.

501
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,799
I'm haunted by uncontrollable
thoughts

502
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,550
of mutilation
and sexual assault

503
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,385
on a near daily basis.

504
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,971
But, you know, I channel it
all into my work.

505
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,681
- Oh. Wow.
- Huh.

506
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,767
I never got that impression
from reading "Marmaduke."

507
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,310
Well, did you get
the impression

508
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,521
I was trying to make
you laugh?

509
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,899
Tell me that wasn't
Brad Anderson.

510
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,109
Aw, see?
You hear that, Morty Jr.?

511
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,320
Maybe you could try being
a creative of some kind.

512
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,364
Maybe!
I always have sort of wanted

513
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,658
to see my face
on the back of a novel.

514
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,661
I mean, what I really want to do
is slit people's throats,

515
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,829
but beyond that...

516
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,122
I know you can do it,
son.

517
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,542
I think it's time I get
a place of my own.

518
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,378
I promise I'll call you
every day I need money

519
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,588
or a place
to do laundry.

[ whoosh! thud! ]

523
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,348
So, I assume this novel
your son writes

524
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,810
is gonna pay for my rear axle?

525
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,520
Isn't it interesting,
Summer,

526
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,522
that after all that stuff
we just did,

527
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,607
nothing really mattered
and there was no point to it?

528
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,651
Kind of makes you wonder,
huh -- about nothing?

529
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,070
Are you sure it doesn't
make you re-evaluate

530
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,322
your policy about taking
girls on adventures?

531
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,449
No. I'd say, given
what we've been through,

532
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,951
that I was right
the whole time

533
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,953
and any epiphanies
about gender politics were

534
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,830
a projection of your feminine
insecurity.

535
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,374
But, hey, why don't you have
a pink spaceship?

536
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,459
Go ride around and have
a jolly old time.

537
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,670
Maybe that'll shut you up.
- Dad? Summer?

538
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,297
Where were you guys
this whole time?

539
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,882
On Gazorpazorp.
Where were you?

540
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,508
I was reading
a newspaper.

541
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,969
Oh, that's interesting, Beth.
You know, it's funny.

542
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,346
l-I-I heard about a little bit
of news myself.

543
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,473

T-Take a listen.

Mortimer Smith, Jr.,

New York Times
bestselling author,

554
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,439
your book is about innocence,
the definition of it,

555
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,441
and, inevitably,
its impossibility.

556
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,276
ls it autobiographical?

557
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,527
Certainly.

558
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,447
I mean, all writing is,
in my opinion.

559
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,408
But my, uh --
[ clears throat ]

560
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,161
My father kept me locked
in the house

561
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,664
until I was a teenager.

562
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,457
And there was violence

563
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,585
and, uh,
threats of poison gas --

564
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,337
but also dancing.

565
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,464
But you persevered
and created this masterpiece

566
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,840
from your suffering.

and on everyone's mind.

Pick it up.
We'll be right back.

It's a thankless job, Morty.

00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,016
You did the best you could.

It's a good-a show!
