00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,950
who who haphazardly, you

688
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,289
know, mixed a bunch of nonsense

689
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,490
together and created a bunch of

690
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,250
cronenbergs!

691
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,320
You got to fix this, Rick!

692
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Morty: all right, all right,

693
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,815
Morty.

694
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,919
You know, w-w-w-we are in a

695
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,289
pretty deep hole, here, but I do

696
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,820
have one emergency solution that

697
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,049
i can use that'll kind of put

698
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,120
everything back to normal,

699
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
relatively speaking.

700
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,820
Here, Morty, put this on while i

701
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,620
do a little bit of scouting.

702
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,389
[Birds chirping]

703
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,919
Morty: wow, Rick, I got to

704
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,190
say you really pulled a

705
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,089
rabbit out of your hat this

706
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,049
time.

707
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,390
I mean, i-i really thought that

708
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,950
the whole place was gonna be

709
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,319
messed up for good, but here,

710
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,819
you did it y-y-you you

711
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,119
you figured out that crazy

712
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,049
solution, like you always do.

713
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:14,049
Whoo!

714
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,070
That's some great luck.

715
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,250
Rick: come on, Morty.

716
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
Luck had nothing to do with it.

717
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,190
I'm great.

718
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,789
That's the real reason.

719
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,720
Now, Morty, what do you say,

720
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,450
buddy?

721
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,019
Will you hand me a screwdriver

722
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,089
so I can finish my ionic dis

723
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,089
defibulizer?

724
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,250
Morty: sure thing, Rick.

725
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,390
Here's a screwdriver.

726
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,750
Rick: all right, Morty.

727
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,990
Thank you very much.

728
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,119
We got one screw turn... and two

729
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,890
screw turns... and...

730
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,369
all right, Morty, here we are.

731
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,789
Morty: oh, my god, Rick!

732
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:44,890
Is that us?!

733
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,990
W-w-w-we're dead!

734
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,819
What is going on, Rick?

735
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm freaking out!

736
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,819
Rick: calm down, Morty!

737
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:49,950
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

738
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,690
Morty: no, I can't deal with

739
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,420
this!

740
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,490
Rick: calm yourself, Morty.

741
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,450
Morty: I can't deal with

742
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,089
this, Rick!

743
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,150
Rick: calm down, Morty.

744
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,220
Morty: this can't be real!

745
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Rick: you got to calm down,

746
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,814
Morty.

747
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,450
Morty: w-w-w-w-we're ripped

748
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,190
apart!

749
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,190
Rick: shut up and listen to

750
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,855
me!

751
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,220
It's fine. Everything is fine.

752
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
There's an infinite number of

753
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,920
realities, Morty, and in a few

754
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,089
dozen of those, I got lucky and

755
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:06,089
turned everything back to

756
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:07,784
normal.

757
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,990
I just had to find one of those

758
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,190
realities in which we also

759
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,019
happen to both die around this

760
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:11,019
time.

761
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,420
Now we can just slip into the

762
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,890
place of our dead selves in this

763
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,849
reality and everything will be

764
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:16,720
fine.

765
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,519
We're not skipping a beat,

766
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,289
Morty.

767
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,289
Now, help me with these bodies.

768
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:20,349
Morty: this is insane.

769
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,450
Rick: look, Morty, I'll grab

770
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,789
myself, you grab yourself, okay?

771
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:23,990
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to

772
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,049
me I mean, that seems like a

773
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,150
fair way to divvy it up.

774
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,190
Morty: Rick, what about the

775
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,289
reality we left behind?

776
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,390
Rick: what about the reality

777
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,089
where hitler cured cancer,

778
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,019
Morty?

779
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:31,019
The answer is don't think about

780
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,455
it.

781
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,690
It's not like we can do this

782
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,720
every week, anyways.

783
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,589
We get three or four more of

784
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,390
these, tops.

785
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,420
Now, pick up your dead self and

786
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,420
come on.

787
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,215
Haste makes waste.

788
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,450
I-i-i don't suppose you've

789
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,849
considered this detail, but

790
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,220
obviously, if I hadn't screwed

791
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,819
up as much as I did, we'd be

792
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,019
these guys right now, so, again,

793
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,549
you're welcome.

Summer: you know, the thing

814
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,950
about a shark...

815
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,549
he's got lifeless eyes...

816
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,549
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

817
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,250
When he comes at ya, he doesn't

818
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,950
seem to be living until he bites

819
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,420
ya, and then the the blood,

820
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,890
and the red, and the water...

821
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,150
Jerry: [sighs]

822
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,049
you ever wonder what happened to

823
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,190
Rick and Morty?

824
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,819
Beth: sometimes.

825
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,319
But, I'm ashamed to admit, now

826
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,619
that they're gone, I'm finally

827
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,390
happy.

828
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,519
Rick: here we are,

829
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,019
cronenberg Morty a reality

830
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,220
where everyone in the world got

831
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,250
genetically cronenberged.

832
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,190
We'll fit right in,

833
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,289
cronenberg Morty.

834
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,289
It'll be like we never even left

835
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,349
cronenberg world.

836
00:20:58,349 --> 00:20:59,750
Morty: yeah, cronenberg Rick,

837
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,849
but, you know, I'm gonna miss

838
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:01,950
cronenberg world, because

839
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,990
everyone was cronenberged all

840
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,920
along like us from the

841
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
beginning, you know?

842
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
I mean, i-i wish we hadn't

843
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,420
genetically ruined cronenberg

844
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,920
world beyond repair like we did,

845
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,220
you know, and turned everyone

846
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,289
into regular, normal people just

847
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:12,349
walking around.

848
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:13,650
Rick: don't you worry about

849
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,589
that sort of thing,

850
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:15,549
cronenberg Morty.

851
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,619
Let's go make ourselves at home,

852
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,650
huh?
