 Transcript 
[Open Ext. Smith residence]
(Outside, there is snow on the ground. The Smith house is
decorated for Christmas, and Jerry can be heard singing Last King Christmas.)
Jerry:
*singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!
[Trans Int. Kitchen]
(The kitchen is a mess of food in various stages of
preparation. Jerry pulls a ham out of the oven as he sings.)
Jerry: *singing*
In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you
are really giving it to this ham.
(Jerry enters the living room, where a tree stands with
presents underneath it. Beth and Morty are occupied on tablets while Summer
uses her smartphone.)
Jerry: Um,
Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming
over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?
Beth: Alive?
For your parents?
(Jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.)
Jerry: Good
one.
Beth: Hey man!
Jerry: You ‘hey
man’! This holiday is about humanity.
Morty: *not
looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born
half-God or something.
Jerry: Okay,
whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.
Morty: *hands
over his tablet* Ohhhh…
Summer: Dad, I’m not giving you my phone.
Jerry: Put it
in the stocking, Summer, or I’m joining Facebook.
(Summer gasps and drops her phone in the stocking.)
Rick:
*offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody.
(Rick and Ruben enter the house and Jerry approaches
them.)
Jerry: More
like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
Rick: Calm
down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.
Ruben: Pearl
Harbor.
Rick: I check
in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.
Beth: Aw, Dad…
That is so sweet.
Jerry:
*squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don’t get it.
Ruben: Korea.
Rick: Don’t
worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I’ll be in
my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.
(Rick and Ruben head out to the garage.)
Jerry: Huh.
You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there’s my parents. Now
remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like
old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!
(Leonard and Joyce walk in.)
Leonard: Merry
Christmas, son.
(Jerry, not noticing Jacob, almost closes the door on
him, then opens it back up.)
Jerry: Oh, hi.
Can I help you?
Joyce: Jerry,
this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn’t you get our text message?
Beth, Summer, and
Morty: No.
Jacob: You
must be Jerry! That’s a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?
Jerry: *smiling
uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you’re a…friend of
the family…?
Leonard: *puts
an arm around Jacob’s shoulders* The way we see it, he’s a part of the family.
Jerry: Wow!
Joyce: After
your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and
wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we
going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real
experiences?
Beth: Holy
crap, Joyce. That’s amazing.
Leonard: Then
Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.
(Jacob puts his arms around Joyce and Leonard.)
Jacob: All
three of us.
(Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob giggle. Jerry stares at them,
confused and uncomfortable.)
Jerry: …Cool…
Eggnog?
Jacob: Now we
are talkin’! This man’s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?
(All laugh. Rick enters and starts laughing with the
rest.)
Rick: Hi
Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there.
Jacob: Merry
Christmas, man.
Rick: Morty! A
moment of your time?
[Trans. Rick’s garage]
(Ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. He’s
naked besides a towel over his genitals and his Santa hat.)
Rick: He’s in
bad shape, Morty.
Morty: Aw
geez, Rick! What did you do?
Rick: Gee,
thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I’m sittin’ here trying
to save the guy’s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and
puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He’ll know
what’s goin’ on.
Morty:
*extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
Rick: In
Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head*
Morty: Ruben…
Minnesota?
Rick: Ruben on
the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don’t have time
for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into
view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs
will collapse.
(Rick sets Morty under the shrink ray.)
Morty: W-What
proc—
(Rick activates the shrink ray and Morty shrieks as he’s
shrunk down to a microscopic size. Rick picks up the container Morty shrank
into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into Ruben’s chest. Just then, Beth
enters the garage.)
Beth: Hey Dad,
where’s Morty?
Rick: He’s
busy.
[Trans. Int. Ruben’s body]
(Morty continues screaming as he is injected into the
body in a stream of pink fluid. He lands on something soft and abruptly stops
shouting.)
Rick (through
Morty’s earpiece): Morty, can you hear me? Head North!
Morty: Rick…
Where am I?
[Trans. Garage]
Rick: *adjusts
his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be
just south of the entrance.
Morty (through
Rick’s earpiece): The entrance to what?
Rick: Welcome,
Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty
gasps.) …to Anatomy Park!
(The view pans to show an amusement park with a large
Anatomy Park sign and various attractions and exhibits.)
Rick: It’s a
little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty
enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn’t cheap,
Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.
Morty: Oh my
God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
Rick: You got
a problem with that last one, Morty?
Morty: Huh?
No, no, I’m just reading them out loud in the order I’m seeing them.
Rick: Okay,
alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas
was my baby.
[Trans. Garage]
Rick: I-I got
a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I’m still a little
defensive. Let’s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I’m picking up a distress
signal in the liver, Morty.
[Trans. Anatomy Park.]
Rick: Proceed
to the liver.
(Following a sign posting directions, Morty hurries off
in the direction of the ‘Haunted Liver,’ taking a shuttle to ‘Lower Abdomenland’.)
Automated voice:
Arriving at ‘Liver’.
Morty: *stumbles
forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!
Automated voice:
Mind the gap.
(Morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area
with flickering lights.)
Morty: It’s
really scary in here, Rick.
Rick: Liver’s
under maintenance. Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. Don’t judge. You don’t
agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great.
[Trans. Int. Haunted Liver]
(Morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. An animatronic
wolf suddenly springs up behind him.)
Morty:
OOOOHHH! Rick, it’s a monster!
Rick: No no,
Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is
mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf.
(A hand reaches from around the corner and a large, muscular man with a thick accent grips Morty by the throat, lifting him up and
pinning him to the wall with his forearm.)
Poncho: Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
Morty: Mmm!
M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
Dr. Bloom:
Poncho! That’s quite enough.
(Dr. Bloom walks into the room. He appears to be a blob
of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. Poncho glares,
then reluctantly lets Morty fall to the ground.)
Dr. Bloom:
Morty, that’s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is
Roger and Annie.
Morty:
*staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh…
Dr. Bloom: And
I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
(A speaker apparatus emerges from Morty’s helmet. Rick
speaks through it.)
Rick: Hey
Bloom, it’s Rick. What the hell’s goin’ on here?
Dr. Bloom: I
don’t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I’m afraid
the exhibits are unlocked.
(Rick’s speaker retreats into Morty’s helmet.)
Morty:
Exhibits?
[Trans. Ext. Haunted Liver]
Dr. Bloom:
Anatomy Park’s greatest attraction, young man, isn’t the music or the food or
the Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick: Watch
it.
Dr. Bloom: It
is first and foremost a living museum of humanity’s most noble and ferocious
diseases.
Morty:
Diseases?!
(There’s a distant roaring noise.)
Poncho: Hey
Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living
museum is officially a wild safari!
(Poncho begins shooting at Hepatitis A.)
Roger:
Hepatitis A! Run!
(The entire group screams and flees.)
[Trans. Dining room]
(The Smith family, sans Rick and Morty, are seated for
dinner with Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob.)
Jacob: Oh…
*leans over and wipes some food from Joyce’s mouth with a napkin* The food goes
in your mouth, girl!
(All laugh, but Jerry’s laugh is forced.)
Jerry: Aha… I’m
sorry Jacob, I guess I’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of
your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker?
Is that what it is?
Joyce: We can
go into detail later, son.
Leonard: Now
wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. Let’s all live and die honestly. Your
mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.
(Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry’s smile
becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when
eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an
opportunity to share and experiment.
Jerry: Dad,
please, what are you saying?
Beth: Whatever
it is, it’s beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you.
Jerry: Speak
for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say Jacob is
your lover.
Leonard: No no
no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother’s lover. (Jerry
again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a
closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.
(Joyce kisses Leonard’s cheek and the two hold hands,
looking at each other fondly.)
Jacob: Oh…
*reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*
(Summer and Beth smile. Jerry stares, at a loss for
words.)
Jacob: Jerry,
this ham’s got to be all you, right? It’s in-cred-i-ble.
Summer:
*smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad.
(Jerry appears more despondent than ever.)
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
(Poncho continues shooting at Hepatitis A.)
Poncho:
AHHHHHH!
(The whole group rushes through a door before entering a
code and shutting it.)
Dr. Bloom:
Hepatitis won’t follow us into the respiratory system!
(They enter to a set of doors under a sign reading ‘Alveoli
Forest’. Roger examines a meter near the door.)
Roger: That’s
strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.
Dr. Bloom: So
the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. That’s why security is offline.
Morty: W-Well,
I guess we better check it out.
(The group passes through the doors. As the doors are
closing, Alexander, dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes
through.)
Alexander:
Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*
Dr. Bloom:
*points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!
(Alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head
back on. The whole group examines the area.)
Roger: If we
got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.
Morty: *raises
his hand* I’ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh…
(Morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and
clings to it.)
Poncho: Don’t
be a hero, kid.
Morty: I’m
not. I’m doin’ it because it’s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*
Poncho: *cocks
his gun* We shouldn’t be here.
Dr. Bloom:
Whatever you do, don’t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my
life’s work.
(Annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which
squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.)
Annie: Ah!
Dr. Bloom: It’s
alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but
the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the
scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close
to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!
Morty: Whoa!
*grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!
(Tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. He lets go of
the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.)
Morty: Oh!
What are those things?!
Dr. Bloom:
Tuberculosis, coming in fast!
Poncho: *raises
gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!
Dr. Bloom:
*grabs Poncho’s arm* No! Do you know what you’ve done?!
[Trans. Garage]
(Ruben coughs.)
[Trans. Lungs]
(The force of the cough lifts the whole group off the
ground, then they fall back down.)
Dr. Bloom: Get
to the digestive tract! He’s coughing!
(The group starts running.)
[Trans. Garage]
(Ruben coughs several times again.)
[Trans. Lungs]
(The group all manages to push through besides Alexander.
Morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. Morty
grabs a frond and reaches for Alexander’s hand.)
Alexander:
Waaaah! Don’t let me die!
[Trans. Garage]
(Rick looks down over Ruben’s mouth.)
Rick: Just
take a deep breath, Ruben.
(Ruben inhales deeply.)
[Trans. Lungs]
Morty: You’re
not gonna die! What’s your name?
Alexander: My
name is… *his hand slips from Morty’s and he’s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!
(Alexander’s skin and soft tissue are peeled off as Ruben
coughs into Rick’s face, getting some spittle, including Alexander, on Rick’s
forehead.)
(The group, minus the now-dead Alexander, escape the
respiratory system. Morty presses the speaker on his helmet.)
Morty: Rick!
Ruben’s got tuberculosis!
[Trans. Garage]
Rick: Oh, great
work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I’ll just cure it, and
then—
(Ruben’s heart monitor flatlines. Rick tosses the syringe
over his shoulder.)
Rick: Okay.
Well I can’t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You’re trapped in a dead man. Listen,
if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
Rick: —and hop
by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I’m biased, but, I think it’s great,
Morty.
[Trans. Garage]
Rick: *sitting
in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around
a-a-a- pancreas. We don’t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really
rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I’m just saying,
if that becomes impossible—
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
(The group listens to Rick, all looking glum.)
Rick: —please,
you gotta treat yourself.
(The group is headed to the digestive tract.)
Morty: Geez,
what’s that horrible smell?
Dr. Bloom: You
mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I’m kidding. (As he speaks,
Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is
beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy.
Anatomy Park is doomed.
Morty: Forget
about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!
Dr. Bloom: The
digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There’s an emergency station
in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
Morty:
Everybody! Get to the colon!
Poncho: Now I’m
takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
(As they walk, Dr. Bloom speaks privately with Morty.)
Dr. Bloom:
Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster
was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by
her manager at the churro stand.
Roger: Intestines
are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.
(Morty slows to walk beside Annie.)
Morty: Hey,
just so you know, I-I’m actually fourteen. So, you know…
Annie: What?
Morty: Not
twelve.
Annie: Okay.
Morty: Because
he just said I was twelve.
Annie: Oh.
Good for you.
(She walks ahead of him.)
Rick (through
speaker): Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.
Morty: *slumps
forward* Nnn…
[Trans. Small intestine]
(The group travel down the small intestine in a raft,
surrounded by animatronics singing ‘It’s a Small, Small Intestine.’)
Animatronics:
*singing* It’s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It’s a pathway that breaks
up the fat in food. It’s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It’s a
small, small intestine!
Roger: It goes
on like this for miles…
Dr. Bloom:
*excitedly* And then we get to the large
intestine!
(A low rumbling can be heard.)
Poncho: Shh.
*shines flashlight* I hear something.
(Gonorrhea rises up from the river of waste.)
Dr. Bloom:
*whispers* Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move.
(Gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.)
Dr. Bloom:
Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
(Poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire,
Gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. They swim to the ‘shore’
on the side of the intestine.)
Annie: We’re
sitting ducks!
Morty: Doc!
Didn’t you say the body was filling up with gas?
Dr. Bloom:
Yes. Why?
Poncho: Kid!
You’re a genius! *pulls out a match*
Dr. Bloom: Are
you mad?!
Morty: *grabs
Annie’s hand* Everybody! In here!
(They all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining.
Poncho lights the match.)
Poncho: Hey
Gonorrhea! How’s this for a burning sensation?
(He throws the match towards the disease, where it
ignites the gas and causes an explosion. Gonorrhea falls down, dead. Annie hugs
Morty, who laughs.)
[Trans. Smith family living room]
(Leonard, Summer, Joyce, Jacob, Beth, and Jerry sit in a
semicircle on the carpet. Jerry scowls and slumps. Leonard is playing a set of
bongos while Summer sings.)
Summer:
*singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas
drums!
Leonard: Oh,
Summer. Sing it! Haha.
Summer:
Christmas drums being played by a boy!
(Beth is clapping along when she notices Jerry sulking.
She puts an arm around him.)
Beth: Jerry,
come on. This is what you wanted.
Jerry: I get
it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I’m being punished for taking your
iPad.
Beth: What?
Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I’m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let’s just be
here.
(Ethan walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets
himself into the house.)
Ethan: Ugh…
Summer!
Summer:
*stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?
Ethan: I’ve
been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
Summer: I don’t
have my phone! I’m doing a human holiday!
Ethan: Did you
even consider how that might make me feel?
Summer: How
you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
Jerry: *stands
up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?
Ethan: Yeah,
do you, Summer?
Summer: I don’t
know Ethan, do I?
Jacob: *stands
up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer’s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but
you really need to connect more with your family, man.
(Jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.)
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
(The group runs through another metal security door and
hurry down a platform to a growth ray.)
Roger: I
should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back
online. If it works, we’ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope
Ruben’s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.
(Something roars in the distance, causing the area to
rumble.)
Poncho: What
the hell is that?
Dr. Bloom: The
sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not
designed to hold a corpse-load.
(The dam is clearly close to giving way. Roger keeps
working to get the growth ray active.)
Roger: Almost
got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!
(Morty notices a strange, black creature in Poncho’s
backpack.)
Morty: Poncho?
What is this in your backpack?
(Poncho turns around to face Morty, giving Dr. Bloom a
view of the creature.)
Dr. Bloom:
That’s bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?
(Poncho grabs hold of Annie and holds a knife to her
throat. Annie gasps and tries to kick free.)
Poncho:
Everybody get back!
Dr. Bloom:
Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal
from me?
Poncho:
*laughs* That’s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate
the population. I’ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea.
Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that
are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than
working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes
Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—
Morty:
AHHHHH!!!
(Morty leaps up and grabs onto Poncho’s helmet, allowing
Annie to escape. He punches Poncho repeatedly before Poncho pulls him off his
face and throws him to the ground, where Roger helps him up. Poncho laughs
evilly, but stops short when Bubonic Plague bites his shoulder.)
Poncho: Ah!
Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!
(The four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his
death. Just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.)
Annie: You
guys!
Roger: It’s
gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying
to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot
is stuck!
(Morty holds Annie back as she makes to help Roger.)
Annie: No!
Roger: This is
okay! It’s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find
because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I
dunno, you can—
(Just then, the dam bursts, drowning Roger in Ruben’s
excrement.)
Annie: No!
(Dr. Bloom seals the door to the chamber and Annie hugs
Morty, distraught and crying.)
[Trans. Smith family living room]
(Leonard, Joyce, and Beth sit on the chair and sofa,
Jerry and Summer stand, and Jacob kneels with Ethan in the center of the room.)
Jacob: Let me
ask you something Ethan. Where’s the anger coming from, man?
Ethan: From
Summer being a total bitch!
(Jacob takes hold of Ethan’s cheeks and forces him to
make eye contact.)
Jacob: Where’s
the anger coming from?
Ethan: …My
brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears
fill his eyes* I can’t… I can’t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made
me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I’m… m-made me a girl!
(Jacob helps Ethan up to his feet.)
Jacob: He
didn’t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is
who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to
her. Brand new.
(Ethan walks over to Summer.)
Ethan: Come
here right now!
Summer: Oh my
god, I’m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!
Ethan: I love
you so much.
(The two begin making out. Everyone claps besides Jerry.)
Jerry: Um…
Joyce: You did
it again, cubby. Come here.
(Joyce and Jacob begin to kiss. Jerry looks to the easy
chair to see Leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning
his shirt to reveal a Superman costume underneath.)
Jerry: No!
Stop! I hate this!
(Beth, Joyce, and Jacob glare at him.)
Joyce: Well,
Christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son.
Jerry: Well
then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.
(He walks out. Summer and Ethan and Joyce and Jacob
continue kissing.)
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
(The three survivors are in a small theater where an
animatronic Ruben gives a presentation. Morty and Annie have their helmets off
and are making out, and Dr. Bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.)
Animatronic Ruben: My name’s Ruben Ridley. You’re inside
me right now, but by the end of this journey, I’ll be inside all of you.
(Dr. Bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream,
probably due to his semi-aqueous form.)
Animatronic Ruben: My story begins in the dot com crash
in the early ‘90s.
(The animatronic sparks, then goes limp.)
Annie:
*whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want…
Rick (through
speaker): Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (Annie and Morty
both look at Morty’s helmet, startled.)
[Trans. Garage]
(Rick is working on a computer, still talking to Morty
through his headset.)
Rick: I’m
trying to concentrate.
(Jerry wanders to the door.)
Jerry: Ah,
Rick?
Rick: *holds
up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much
smaller fish to fry.
Jerry: *enters
anyway* I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong
table, looking down at Ruben’s corpse* Right now, you’re my sanest relative.
(Rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.)
Rick:
Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of
dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?
[Trans. Anatomy Park]
(Annie is in Morty’s lap.)
Morty: Are you
kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.
Rick (through
speaker): Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben’s left nipple!
(The area begins to rumble and cave in. Morty lifts Annie
off his lap and both put on their helmets.)
Morty: We need
to get to the left nipple!
Dr. Bloom: The
body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the ‘ceiling’.) The
arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It’s
connected to the skeletal system. That’s why we call it the Bone Train. *to
Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?
Annie: If
it’ll get us out of here.
Dr. Bloom: How
about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?
Morty: Why are
you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let’s go.
[Trans. Garage]
(Jerry looks on as Rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into
an incision on Ruben’s abdomen. He takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.)
Jerry: Well, I
can see that you’re busy… Merry Christmas, Rick.
(Rick lifts Ruben’s corpse from the table and heads out
to the car, dumping Ruben’s body inside.)
[Trans. Anatomy Park: the Bone Train]
Dr. Bloom:
There’s no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
(Morty and Annie glance at each other, then look back at
Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom glances at each of the teenagers. Morty and Annie continue
staring at him.)
Morty: …Uh,
well…
Dr. Bloom: No,
you’re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my
fault. You go on.
(Something approaches the group from a nearby set of
stairs.)
Annie:
*points* What the hell is that?
Dr. Bloom: E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
(Morty and Annie jump into the shuttle as E. coli swarm
the area. Dr. Bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.)
Dr. Bloom: Oh
wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER
MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!
(As the train speeds down the track, some of the E. coli
have attached themselves to the vehicle. One smashes the window of the train
door and sticks its head inside.)
Annie: They’re
chewing through the doors!
Morty:
Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with
it* We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really
bad situation!
[Trans. Earth’s orbit]
(Rick flies his spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere.)
Rick: I’m
almost there, Morty!
(Rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in Ruben’s
abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase Ruben to
an enormous size—large enough to make Morty and Annie their normal sizes again,
but still inside him.)
[Trans. Earth]
(Various people across America stop what they’re doing
and look at the sky as Ruben’s huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.)
Reporter:
Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant
naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New
York. Tom?
(As Tom speaks, Ruben’s terrifyingly enormous face floats
overhead.)
Tom: Well, his eyes aren’t twinkling, and his dimples
aren’t merry, but I’m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!
Reporter:
Thank you, Tom. Let’s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.
(Ruben’s poorly kept toes hover in the background while
Eric speaks.)
Eric: We’ve
got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant
man’s size! And you know what they say about that!
Reporter: Well,
if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky
Mountains.
[Trans. Rocky Mountains]
(A lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up,
screams, and runs away.)
[Trans. Earth’s orbit]
(Rick flies his ship toward the nipple.)
[Trans. Bone Train]
(E. coli continue trying to break in, with Morty beating
them away with a fire extinguisher. Running up to the front of the train, he
and Annie see that Hepatitis A is has damaged the track.)
Morty: Oh my
god, the track!
Annie: It’s
Hepatitis A!
(As Morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the
track and straight through some of Ruben’s soft tissue, bursting into the
nipple. The train hits a bump, throwing Morty and Annie out. They look up and
gasp.)
Annie: The
nipple hole…
(Through the nipple hole, they’re able to see Earth as
the sun peeks over the horizon.)
Morty: It’s
beautiful…
(Suddenly, there’s a crash behind them. Hepatitis A
bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards Morty and Annie.)
Annie: Aw no!
(The two run, and just as Hepatitis A is about to catch
them, Hepatitis C snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.)
Annie: Whoa!
It’s Hepatitis C!
(Hepatitis C gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away
with its kill in its mouth.)
Morty: Um… We…
Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
Annie: I…
think they’re just like that? I think they’re just good guys.
Morty: Oh.
Huh.
(Rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it
behind them. Morty and Annie climb inside.)
Rick: Where’s
Dr. Bloom?
Morty: Sorry
Rick… He’s dead…
Rick: Goddamn
it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!
(Rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from
Ruben’s corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood
and gore in all directions.)
[Trans. Smith residence]
(Joyce, Leonard, Jacob, Beth, Summer, and Ethan all
bundle up to go sledding.)
Beth: Jerry
doesn’t know what he’s missing.
Jacob: He’ll
come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing
families together.
Beth: I dunno,
Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don’t
know if our marriage will—
(Beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding
glass doors. The whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the
sky.)
Summer: It’s
raining blood!
Jacob: Listen,
find Jerry!
Beth: Oh god.
[Trans. Jerry’s den]
(Blood is raining on the window there as well. Jerry is
sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.)
Beth: Jerry!
Jerry: *stands
and hugs her* It’s alright! The TV says there’s nothing to worry about.
Reporter (on TV):
The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining
down on the country. Everything should be fine.
(Family sighs in relief.)
Summer: Dad,
can I have my phone back?
Jerry: Sure,
sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth
her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It’ll help you relax.
Jacob: This is
nice.
Jerry: Yeah.
*puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this
Christmas, Jacob.
Summer: No we
didn’t, Dad. No we didn’t.
[Trans. Smith house]
(It’s no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of
Ruben are everywhere as Rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.)
Rick: Too bad
about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The
only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.
Annie:
Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom’s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary
to create a new, much safer park!
Rick: What
about Pirates of the Pancreas…?
Annie: I think
it was one of the most underrated
attractions.
Rick: Booyah!
Hold your breath!
(Annie is already standing under the shrink ray as Rick
pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to
Morty’s chagrin.)
Morty: Hey,
wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had
somethin’ going there, Rick!
(Rick pockets the container holding Annie.)
Rick: Yeah, so
I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina.
Morty: W-What’s
wrong with that? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
Rick: C’mon.
Let’s get some stuffing, I’m starving.
[Trans. Smith family living room]
(Beth, Leonard, Summer, and Ethan sit on the couch, Jacob
sits in the easy chair with Joyce in his lap, and Jerry sits on the carpet. All
are staring at handheld electronics as Rick and Morty enter the room.)
Rick: Oh,
unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their
faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize
Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you
people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?
(Jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.)
[End Credits roll]
[Trans. Rick’s garage]
Annie (through
speaker phone): Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?
Rick: Loud and
clear, Annie.
Annie: Great!
We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—
Alejandro: Hey
Rick.
Annie: Natalie
Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts
and Jamie from New Media.
Rick: Hey
everybody.
All: Hey, hi
Rick, how’s it goin’. (etc.)
Annie: So.
Pirates of the Pancreas.
Rick: Yeah,
talk to me.
Alejandro: Hey
Rick, it’s Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked
ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” (Rick begins to look
agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you
know? So we’re starting with a new—
(Rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up
on the group call. Behind him, Ethan lies on a table.)
Ethan: So
those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?
Rick: Those
guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They’re inside you
building a monument to compromise! Fuck. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole
thing, Ethan.
Ethan: … Cool.
And who pays me?

[Open Ext. Smith residence]

(Outside, there is snow on the ground. The Smith house is
decorated for Christmas, and Jerry can be heard singing Last King Christmas.)

Jerry:
*singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!

[Trans Int. Kitchen]

(The kitchen is a mess of food in various stages of
preparation. Jerry pulls a ham out of the oven as he sings.)

Jerry: *singing*
In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm… Jerry, you
are really giving it to this ham.

(Jerry enters the living room, where a tree stands with
presents underneath it. Beth and Morty are occupied on tablets while Summer
uses her smartphone.)

Jerry: Um,
Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming
over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?

Beth: Alive?
For your parents?

(Jerry snags her tablet away and stows it in a stocking.)

Jerry: Good
one.

Beth: Hey man!

Jerry: You ‘hey
man’! This holiday is about humanity.

Morty: *not
looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born
half-God or something.

Jerry: Okay,
whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.

Morty: *hands
over his tablet* Ohhhh…

Summer: Dad, I’m not giving you my phone.

Jerry: Put it
in the stocking, Summer, or I’m joining Facebook.

(Summer gasps and drops her phone in the stocking.)

Rick:
*offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody.

(Rick and Ruben enter the house and Jerry approaches
them.)

Jerry: More
like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!

Rick: Calm
down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.

Ruben: Pearl
Harbor.

Rick: I check
in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.

Beth: Aw, Dad…
That is so sweet.

Jerry:
*squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is… I don’t get it.

Ruben: Korea.

Rick: Don’t
worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I’ll be in
my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.

(Rick and Ruben head out to the garage.)

Jerry: Huh.
You think you know a guy. (The doorbell rings.) Okay, there’s my parents. Now
remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like
old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!

(Leonard and Joyce walk in.)

Leonard: Merry
Christmas, son.

(Jerry, not noticing Jacob, almost closes the door on
him, then opens it back up.)

Jerry: Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

Joyce: Jerry,
this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn’t you get our text message?

Beth, Summer, and
Morty: No.

Jacob: You
must be Jerry! That’s a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?

Jerry: *smiling
uncomfortably* I wish… But thank you. *closes the door* So… you’re a…friend of
the family…?

Leonard: *puts
an arm around Jacob’s shoulders* The way we see it, he’s a part of the family.

Jerry: Wow!

Joyce: After
your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and
wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we
going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real
experiences?

Beth: Holy
crap, Joyce. That’s amazing.

Leonard: Then
Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.

(Jacob puts his arms around Joyce and Leonard.)

Jacob: All
three of us.

(Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob giggle. Jerry stares at them,
confused and uncomfortable.)

Jerry: …Cool…
Eggnog?

Jacob: Now we
are talkin’! This man’s got the apron and the eggnog, huh?

(All laugh. Rick enters and starts laughing with the
rest.)

Rick: Hi
Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there.

Jacob: Merry
Christmas, man.

Rick: Morty! A
moment of your time?

[Trans. Rick’s garage]

(Ruben is in fits, laid out on a ping-pong table. He’s
naked besides a towel over his genitals and his Santa hat.)

Rick: He’s in
bad shape, Morty.

Morty: Aw
geez, Rick! What did you do?

Rick: Gee,
thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I’m sittin’ here trying
to save the guy’s life! (Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and
puts an earpiece on his head.) I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He’ll know
what’s goin’ on.

Morty:
*extremely nervous* Uh… W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?

Rick: In
Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head*

Morty: Ruben…
Minnesota?

Rick: Ruben on
the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don’t have time
for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into
view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs
will collapse.

(Rick sets Morty under the shrink ray.)

Morty: W-What
proc—

(Rick activates the shrink ray and Morty shrieks as he’s
shrunk down to a microscopic size. Rick picks up the container Morty shrank
into and puts it into a syringe, which he stabs into Ruben’s chest. Just then, Beth
enters the garage.)

Beth: Hey Dad,
where’s Morty?

Rick: He’s
busy.

[Trans. Int. Ruben’s body]

(Morty continues screaming as he is injected into the
body in a stream of pink fluid. He lands on something soft and abruptly stops
shouting.)

Rick (through
Morty’s earpiece): Morty, can you hear me? Head North!

Morty: Rick…
Where am I?

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: *adjusts
his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be
just south of the entrance.

Morty (through
Rick’s earpiece): The entrance to what?

Rick: Welcome,
Morty. (The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben.) Welcome… (Morty
gasps.) …to Anatomy Park!

(The view pans to show an amusement park with a large
Anatomy Park sign and various attractions and exhibits.)

Rick: It’s a
little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. (Morty
enters the park.) An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn’t cheap,
Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.

Morty: Oh my
God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?

Rick: You got
a problem with that last one, Morty?

Morty: Huh?
No, no, I’m just reading them out loud in the order I’m seeing them.

Rick: Okay,
alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas
was my baby.

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: I-I got
a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I’m still a little
defensive. Let’s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I’m picking up a distress
signal in the liver, Morty.

[Trans. Anatomy Park.]

Rick: Proceed
to the liver.

(Following a sign posting directions, Morty hurries off
in the direction of the ‘Haunted Liver,’ taking a shuttle to ‘Lower Abdomenland’.)

Automated voice:
Arriving at ‘Liver’.

Morty: *stumbles
forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!

Automated voice:
Mind the gap.

(Morty exits the train and enters a dark, unkempt area
with flickering lights.)

Morty: It’s
really scary in here, Rick.

Rick: Liver’s
under maintenance. Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. Don’t judge. You don’t
agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great.

[Trans. Int. Haunted Liver]

(Morty enters a haunted house-style attraction. An animatronic
wolf suddenly springs up behind him.)

Morty:
OOOOHHH! Rick, it’s a monster!

Rick: No no,
Morty. The only monster here is alco— *belch* —holism. (The wolf is
mechanically pulled back into the wall.) That is an animatronic werewolf.

(A hand reaches from around the corner and a large, muscular man with a thick accent grips Morty by the throat, lifting him up and
pinning him to the wall with his forearm.)

Poncho: Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?

Morty: Mmm!
M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!

Dr. Bloom:
Poncho! That’s quite enough.

(Dr. Bloom walks into the room. He appears to be a blob
of goo in a roughly human shape with glasses and a walking cane. Poncho glares,
then reluctantly lets Morty fall to the ground.)

Dr. Bloom:
Morty, that’s Poncho. (Another man and a girl walk into the room.) This is
Roger and Annie.

Morty:
*staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh…

Dr. Bloom: And
I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

(A speaker apparatus emerges from Morty’s helmet. Rick
speaks through it.)

Rick: Hey
Bloom, it’s Rick. What the hell’s goin’ on here?

Dr. Bloom: I
don’t know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I’m afraid
the exhibits are unlocked.

(Rick’s speaker retreats into Morty’s helmet.)

Morty:
Exhibits?

[Trans. Ext. Haunted Liver]

Dr. Bloom:
Anatomy Park’s greatest attraction, young man, isn’t the music or the food or
the Pirates of the Pancreas.

Rick: Watch
it.

Dr. Bloom: It
is first and foremost a living museum of humanity’s most noble and ferocious
diseases.

Morty:
Diseases?!

(There’s a distant roaring noise.)

Poncho: Hey
Doc, I have news for ya. (Hepatitis A lumbers towards the group.) Your living
museum is officially a wild safari!

(Poncho begins shooting at Hepatitis A.)

Roger:
Hepatitis A! Run!

(The entire group screams and flees.)

[Trans. Dining room]

(The Smith family, sans Rick and Morty, are seated for
dinner with Joyce, Leonard, and Jacob.)

Jacob: Oh…
*leans over and wipes some food from Joyce’s mouth with a napkin* The food goes
in your mouth, girl!

(All laugh, but Jerry’s laugh is forced.)

Jerry: Aha… I’m
sorry Jacob, I guess I’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of
your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker?
Is that what it is?

Joyce: We can
go into detail later, son.

Leonard: Now
wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. Let’s all live and die honestly. Your
mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.
(Jerry and Jacob smile at each other, but when Jacob looks away, Jerry’s smile
becomes a glare.) And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when
eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an
opportunity to share and experiment.

Jerry: Dad,
please, what are you saying?

Beth: Whatever
it is, it’s beautiful Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you.

Jerry: Speak
for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say Jacob is
your lover.

Leonard: No no
no no no no. (Jerry sighs in relief.) Jacob is your mother’s lover. (Jerry
again looks disturbed.) I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a
closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.

(Joyce kisses Leonard’s cheek and the two hold hands,
looking at each other fondly.)

Jacob: Oh…
*reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*

(Summer and Beth smile. Jerry stares, at a loss for
words.)

Jacob: Jerry,
this ham’s got to be all you, right? It’s in-cred-i-ble.

Summer:
*smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad.

(Jerry appears more despondent than ever.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(Poncho continues shooting at Hepatitis A.)

Poncho:
AHHHHHH!

(The whole group rushes through a door before entering a
code and shutting it.)

Dr. Bloom:
Hepatitis won’t follow us into the respiratory system!

(They enter to a set of doors under a sign reading ‘Alveoli
Forest’. Roger examines a meter near the door.)

Roger: That’s
strange… *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.

Dr. Bloom: So
the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. That’s why security is offline.

Morty: W-Well,
I guess we better check it out.

(The group passes through the doors. As the doors are
closing, Alexander, dressed in a dog mascot costume, rushes up and passes
through.)

Alexander:
Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*

Dr. Bloom:
*points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!

(Alexander pauses a moment before putting the dog head
back on. The whole group examines the area.)

Roger: If we
got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.

Morty: *raises
his hand* I’ll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh…

(Morty jumps onto one of the bouncy, round alveoli and
clings to it.)

Poncho: Don’t
be a hero, kid.

Morty: I’m
not. I’m doin’ it because it’s fun. *he hops from frond to frond*

Poncho: *cocks
his gun* We shouldn’t be here.

Dr. Bloom:
Whatever you do, don’t fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my
life’s work.

(Annie touches a growth of bacteria on some tar, which
squelches, causing her to gasp in fear and recoil.)

Annie: Ah!

Dr. Bloom: It’s
alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but
the scar tissue… *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the
scar tissue* …keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close
to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!

Morty: Whoa!
*grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!

(Tuberculosis begins crawling towards him. He lets go of
the catwalk and bounces back down to the group, pursued by the disease.)

Morty: Oh!
What are those things?!

Dr. Bloom:
Tuberculosis, coming in fast!

Poncho: *raises
gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!

Dr. Bloom:
*grabs Poncho’s arm* No! Do you know what you’ve done?!

[Trans. Garage]

(Ruben coughs.)

[Trans. Lungs]

(The force of the cough lifts the whole group off the
ground, then they fall back down.)

Dr. Bloom: Get
to the digestive tract! He’s coughing!

(The group starts running.)

[Trans. Garage]

(Ruben coughs several times again.)

[Trans. Lungs]

(The group all manages to push through besides Alexander.
Morty rushes back to help him as his dog mask is blown from his face. Morty
grabs a frond and reaches for Alexander’s hand.)

Alexander:
Waaaah! Don’t let me die!

[Trans. Garage]

(Rick looks down over Ruben’s mouth.)

Rick: Just
take a deep breath, Ruben.

(Ruben inhales deeply.)

[Trans. Lungs]

Morty: You’re
not gonna die! What’s your name?

Alexander: My
name is… *his hand slips from Morty’s and he’s coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!

(Alexander’s skin and soft tissue are peeled off as Ruben
coughs into Rick’s face, getting some spittle, including Alexander, on Rick’s
forehead.)

(The group, minus the now-dead Alexander, escape the
respiratory system. Morty presses the speaker on his helmet.)

Morty: Rick!
Ruben’s got tuberculosis!

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: Oh, great
work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I’ll just cure it, and
then—

(Ruben’s heart monitor flatlines. Rick tosses the syringe
over his shoulder.)

Rick: Okay.
Well I can’t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You’re trapped in a dead man. Listen,
if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

Rick: —and hop
by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I’m biased, but, I think it’s great,
Morty.

[Trans. Garage]

Rick: *sitting
in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around
a-a-a- pancreas. We don’t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really
rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I’m just saying,
if that becomes impossible—

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The group listens to Rick, all looking glum.)

Rick: —please,
you gotta treat yourself.

(The group is headed to the digestive tract.)

Morty: Geez,
what’s that horrible smell?

Dr. Bloom: You
mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I’m kidding. (As he speaks,
Poncho and Roger stock up on bottled water from the Panda Express.) The body is
beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy.
Anatomy Park is doomed.

Morty: Forget
about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!

Dr. Bloom: The
digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There’s an emergency station
in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.

Morty:
Everybody! Get to the colon!

Poncho: Now I’m
takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!

(As they walk, Dr. Bloom speaks privately with Morty.)

Dr. Bloom:
Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster
was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by
her manager at the churro stand.

Roger: Intestines
are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.

(Morty slows to walk beside Annie.)

Morty: Hey,
just so you know, I-I’m actually fourteen. So, you know…

Annie: What?

Morty: Not
twelve.

Annie: Okay.

Morty: Because
he just said I was twelve.

Annie: Oh.
Good for you.

(She walks ahead of him.)

Rick (through
speaker): Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.

Morty: *slumps
forward* Nnn…

[Trans. Small intestine]

(The group travel down the small intestine in a raft,
surrounded by animatronics singing ‘It’s a Small, Small Intestine.’)

Animatronics:
*singing* It’s a road of laughter, a trail of food. It’s a pathway that breaks
up the fat in food. It’s a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It’s a
small, small intestine!

Roger: It goes
on like this for miles…

Dr. Bloom:
*excitedly* And then we get to the large
intestine!

(A low rumbling can be heard.)

Poncho: Shh.
*shines flashlight* I hear something.

(Gonorrhea rises up from the river of waste.)

Dr. Bloom:
*whispers* Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move.

(Gonorrhea roars viciously and moves towards them.)

Dr. Bloom:
Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.

(Poncho pulls out a gun, but before he can fire,
Gonorrhea capsizes the boat and they all fall overboard. They swim to the ‘shore’
on the side of the intestine.)

Annie: We’re
sitting ducks!

Morty: Doc!
Didn’t you say the body was filling up with gas?

Dr. Bloom:
Yes. Why?

Poncho: Kid!
You’re a genius! *pulls out a match*

Dr. Bloom: Are
you mad?!

Morty: *grabs
Annie’s hand* Everybody! In here!

(They all rush into a cavity in the intestinal lining.
Poncho lights the match.)

Poncho: Hey
Gonorrhea! How’s this for a burning sensation?

(He throws the match towards the disease, where it
ignites the gas and causes an explosion. Gonorrhea falls down, dead. Annie hugs
Morty, who laughs.)

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Leonard, Summer, Joyce, Jacob, Beth, and Jerry sit in a
semicircle on the carpet. Jerry scowls and slumps. Leonard is playing a set of
bongos while Summer sings.)

Summer:
*singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas
drums!

Leonard: Oh,
Summer. Sing it! Haha.

Summer:
Christmas drums being played by a boy!

(Beth is clapping along when she notices Jerry sulking.
She puts an arm around him.)

Beth: Jerry,
come on. This is what you wanted.

Jerry: I get
it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I’m being punished for taking your
iPad.

Beth: What?
Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I’m sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let’s just be
here.

(Ethan walks up to the sliding glass doors and lets
himself into the house.)

Ethan: Ugh…
Summer!

Summer:
*stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?

Ethan: I’ve
been texting you for hours. What the hell?!

Summer: I don’t
have my phone! I’m doing a human holiday!

Ethan: Did you
even consider how that might make me feel?

Summer: How
you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!

Jerry: *stands
up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?

Ethan: Yeah,
do you, Summer?

Summer: I don’t
know Ethan, do I?

Jacob: *stands
up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer’s shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but
you really need to connect more with your family, man.

(Jerry stares at him, flabbergasted.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The group runs through another metal security door and
hurry down a platform to a growth ray.)

Roger: I
should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back
online. If it works, we’ll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope
Ruben’s not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.

(Something roars in the distance, causing the area to
rumble.)

Poncho: What
the hell is that?

Dr. Bloom: The
sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not
designed to hold a corpse-load.

(The dam is clearly close to giving way. Roger keeps
working to get the growth ray active.)

Roger: Almost
got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!

(Morty notices a strange, black creature in Poncho’s
backpack.)

Morty: Poncho?
What is this in your backpack?

(Poncho turns around to face Morty, giving Dr. Bloom a
view of the creature.)

Dr. Bloom:
That’s bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?

(Poncho grabs hold of Annie and holds a knife to her
throat. Annie gasps and tries to kick free.)

Poncho:
Everybody get back!

Dr. Bloom:
Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal
from me?

Poncho:
*laughs* That’s right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate
the population. I’ll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea.
Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that
are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than
working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes
Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—

Morty:
AHHHHH!!!

(Morty leaps up and grabs onto Poncho’s helmet, allowing
Annie to escape. He punches Poncho repeatedly before Poncho pulls him off his
face and throws him to the ground, where Roger helps him up. Poncho laughs
evilly, but stops short when Bubonic Plague bites his shoulder.)

Poncho: Ah!
Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!

(The four remaining look over the edge as he falls to his
death. Just then, the sphincter dam begins groaning, almost giving way.)

Annie: You
guys!

Roger: It’s
gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying
to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot
is stuck!

(Morty holds Annie back as she makes to help Roger.)

Annie: No!

Roger: This is
okay! It’s okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find
because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I
dunno, you can—

(Just then, the dam bursts, drowning Roger in Ruben’s
excrement.)

Annie: No!

(Dr. Bloom seals the door to the chamber and Annie hugs
Morty, distraught and crying.)

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Leonard, Joyce, and Beth sit on the chair and sofa,
Jerry and Summer stand, and Jacob kneels with Ethan in the center of the room.)

Jacob: Let me
ask you something Ethan. Where’s the anger coming from, man?

Ethan: From
Summer being a total bitch!

(Jacob takes hold of Ethan’s cheeks and forces him to
make eye contact.)

Jacob: Where’s
the anger coming from?

Ethan: …My
brother… took me fishing once…in the bushes… *voice begins choking up as tears
fill his eyes* I can’t… I can’t! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made
me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I’m… m-made me a girl!

(Jacob helps Ethan up to his feet.)

Jacob: He
didn’t make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is
who she is. (Summer watches on with a sympathetic expression.) Now you go to
her. Brand new.

(Ethan walks over to Summer.)

Ethan: Come
here right now!

Summer: Oh my
god, I’m so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!

Ethan: I love
you so much.

(The two begin making out. Everyone claps besides Jerry.)

Jerry: Um…

Joyce: You did
it again, cubby. Come here.

(Joyce and Jacob begin to kiss. Jerry looks to the easy
chair to see Leonard has gotten up and is backing into the closet, unbuttoning
his shirt to reveal a Superman costume underneath.)

Jerry: No!
Stop! I hate this!

(Beth, Joyce, and Jacob glare at him.)

Joyce: Well,
Christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son.

Jerry: Well
then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.

(He walks out. Summer and Ethan and Joyce and Jacob
continue kissing.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(The three survivors are in a small theater where an
animatronic Ruben gives a presentation. Morty and Annie have their helmets off
and are making out, and Dr. Bloom sits a few seats away eating ice cream.)

Animatronic Ruben: My name’s Ruben Ridley. You’re inside
me right now, but by the end of this journey, I’ll be inside all of you.

(Dr. Bloom appears to miss every other bite of ice cream,
probably due to his semi-aqueous form.)

Animatronic Ruben: My story begins in the dot com crash
in the early ‘90s.

(The animatronic sparks, then goes limp.)

Annie:
*whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want…

Rick (through
speaker): Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something? (Annie and Morty
both look at Morty’s helmet, startled.)

[Trans. Garage]

(Rick is working on a computer, still talking to Morty
through his headset.)

Rick: I’m
trying to concentrate.

(Jerry wanders to the door.)

Jerry: Ah,
Rick?

Rick: *holds
up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much
smaller fish to fry.

Jerry: *enters
anyway* I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong
table, looking down at Ruben’s corpse* Right now, you’re my sanest relative.

(Rick, who had been typing away, suddenly pauses.)

Rick:
Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of
dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?

[Trans. Anatomy Park]

(Annie is in Morty’s lap.)

Morty: Are you
kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.

Rick (through
speaker): Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben’s left nipple!

(The area begins to rumble and cave in. Morty lifts Annie
off his lap and both put on their helmets.)

Morty: We need
to get to the left nipple!

Dr. Bloom: The
body is decaying! (Bits of debris begin to fall from the ‘ceiling’.) The
arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It’s
connected to the skeletal system. That’s why we call it the Bone Train. *to
Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?

Annie: If
it’ll get us out of here.

Dr. Bloom: How
about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?

Morty: Why are
you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let’s go.

[Trans. Garage]

(Jerry looks on as Rick inserts a bundle of dynamite into
an incision on Ruben’s abdomen. He takes a few steps back toward the door back to the house.)

Jerry: Well, I
can see that you’re busy… Merry Christmas, Rick.

(Rick lifts Ruben’s corpse from the table and heads out
to the car, dumping Ruben’s body inside.)

[Trans. Anatomy Park: the Bone Train]

Dr. Bloom:
There’s no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.

(Morty and Annie glance at each other, then look back at
Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom glances at each of the teenagers. Morty and Annie continue
staring at him.)

Morty: …Uh,
well…

Dr. Bloom: No,
you’re right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my
fault. You go on.

(Something approaches the group from a nearby set of
stairs.)

Annie:
*points* What the hell is that?

Dr. Bloom: E. coli outbreak. Hurry!

(Morty and Annie jump into the shuttle as E. coli swarm
the area. Dr. Bloom pulls a lever and the shuttle begins to move.)

Dr. Bloom: Oh
wait, there is an autopilot. (E. coli surround him.) WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER
MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!

(As the train speeds down the track, some of the E. coli
have attached themselves to the vehicle. One smashes the window of the train
door and sticks its head inside.)

Annie: They’re
chewing through the doors!

Morty:
Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with
it* We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really
bad situation!

[Trans. Earth’s orbit]

(Rick flies his spacecraft out of Earth’s atmosphere.)

Rick: I’m
almost there, Morty!

(Rick lights the end of the dynamite bundle in Ruben’s
abdomen, kicks him out into space, and uses a growth ray to increase Ruben to
an enormous size—large enough to make Morty and Annie their normal sizes again,
but still inside him.)

[Trans. Earth]

(Various people across America stop what they’re doing
and look at the sky as Ruben’s huge, naked corpse hovers overhead.)

Reporter:
Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant
naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New
York. Tom?

(As Tom speaks, Ruben’s terrifyingly enormous face floats
overhead.)

Tom: Well, his eyes aren’t twinkling, and his dimples
aren’t merry, but I’m standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!

Reporter:
Thank you, Tom. Let’s go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.

(Ruben’s poorly kept toes hover in the background while
Eric speaks.)

Eric: We’ve
got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant
man’s size! And you know what they say about that!

Reporter: Well,
if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky
Mountains.

[Trans. Rocky Mountains]

(A lumberjack pauses while hacking down a tree, looks up,
screams, and runs away.)

[Trans. Earth’s orbit]

(Rick flies his ship toward the nipple.)

[Trans. Bone Train]

(E. coli continue trying to break in, with Morty beating
them away with a fire extinguisher. Running up to the front of the train, he
and Annie see that Hepatitis A is has damaged the track.)

Morty: Oh my
god, the track!

Annie: It’s
Hepatitis A!

(As Morty tries to slow the train down, it flies off the
track and straight through some of Ruben’s soft tissue, bursting into the
nipple. The train hits a bump, throwing Morty and Annie out. They look up and
gasp.)

Annie: The
nipple hole…

(Through the nipple hole, they’re able to see Earth as
the sun peeks over the horizon.)

Morty: It’s
beautiful…

(Suddenly, there’s a crash behind them. Hepatitis A
bursts out from the train wreckage and lumbers towards Morty and Annie.)

Annie: Aw no!

(The two run, and just as Hepatitis A is about to catch
them, Hepatitis C snatches it up and shakes it like felled prey.)

Annie: Whoa!
It’s Hepatitis C!

(Hepatitis C gives them a thumbs-up before lumbering away
with its kill in its mouth.)

Morty: Um… We…
Did we have some sort of relationship with him?

Annie: I…
think they’re just like that? I think they’re just good guys.

Morty: Oh.
Huh.

(Rick flies his spaceship into the nipple, landing it
behind them. Morty and Annie climb inside.)

Rick: Where’s
Dr. Bloom?

Morty: Sorry
Rick… He’s dead…

Rick: Goddamn
it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!

(Rick flies the spaceship out of the nipple and away from
Ruben’s corpse just before the dynamite ignites and the body explodes, sending blood
and gore in all directions.)

[Trans. Smith residence]

(Joyce, Leonard, Jacob, Beth, Summer, and Ethan all
bundle up to go sledding.)

Beth: Jerry
doesn’t know what he’s missing.

Jacob: He’ll
come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing
families together.

Beth: I dunno,
Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don’t
know if our marriage will—

(Beth stops talking as blood starts splattering the sliding
glass doors. The whole group stares in shock as blood seems to pour from the
sky.)

Summer: It’s
raining blood!

Jacob: Listen,
find Jerry!

Beth: Oh god.

[Trans. Jerry’s den]

(Blood is raining on the window there as well. Jerry is
sitting in a chair, watching the news, when the family bursts in.)

Beth: Jerry!

Jerry: *stands
and hugs her* It’s alright! The TV says there’s nothing to worry about.

Reporter (on TV):
The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining
down on the country. Everything should be fine.

(Family sighs in relief.)

Summer: Dad,
can I have my phone back?

Jerry: Sure,
sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth
her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It’ll help you relax.

Jacob: This is
nice.

Jerry: Yeah.
*puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this
Christmas, Jacob.

Summer: No we
didn’t, Dad. No we didn’t.

[Trans. Smith house]

(It’s no longer raining blood, but reddish chunks of
Ruben are everywhere as Rick lands his spacecraft, parking it in the garage.)

Rick: Too bad
about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The
only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.

Annie:
Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom’s work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary
to create a new, much safer park!

Rick: What
about Pirates of the Pancreas…?

Annie: I think
it was one of the most underrated
attractions.

Rick: Booyah!
Hold your breath!

(Annie is already standing under the shrink ray as Rick
pulls the lever, shrinking her down to microscopic size once again, much to
Morty’s chagrin.)

Morty: Hey,
wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had
somethin’ going there, Rick!

(Rick pockets the container holding Annie.)

Rick: Yeah, so
I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina.

Morty: W-What’s
wrong with that? That doesn’t sound like a problem to me! I dunno!

Rick: C’mon.
Let’s get some stuffing, I’m starving.

[Trans. Smith family living room]

(Beth, Leonard, Summer, and Ethan sit on the couch, Jacob
sits in the easy chair with Joyce in his lap, and Jerry sits on the carpet. All
are staring at handheld electronics as Rick and Morty enter the room.)

Rick: Oh,
unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their
faces stuffed in computer screens. (No one acknowledges him.) Do you realize
Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you
people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?

(Jerry looks at the audience and shrugs.)

[End Credits roll]

[Trans. Rick’s garage]

Annie (through
speaker phone): Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?

Rick: Loud and
clear, Annie.

Annie: Great!
We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—

Alejandro: Hey
Rick.

Annie: Natalie
Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts
and Jamie from New Media.

Rick: Hey
everybody.

All: Hey, hi
Rick, how’s it goin’. (etc.)

Annie: So.
Pirates of the Pancreas.

Rick: Yeah,
talk to me.

Alejandro: Hey
Rick, it’s Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked
ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” (Rick begins to look
agitated.) And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you
know? So we’re starting with a new—

(Rick, furious, picks up and slams the phone, hanging up
on the group call. Behind him, Ethan lies on a table.)

Ethan: So
those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?

Rick: Those
guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They’re inside you
building a monument to compromise! Fuck. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole
thing, Ethan.

Ethan: … Cool.
And who pays me?
